Chrysler Building,"One of the most recognizable and favored structures of New York, the Chrysler was the world's tallest building when completed in 1930, but lost that title to the nearby Empire State Building less than a year later. But what it lost in fame it makes up for in beauty, with its gorgeous, instantly recognizable Art Deco crown."
Citigroup Center,"With its distinctive slanted roof and long, slender base columns, this building is another great skyscraper with a grand atrium."
Daily News Building,"This Art Deco design classic, completed in 1930 to a design by Raymond Hood, was made famous by the Superman films; to be admired are the extreme verticality of the design, the understated setbacks and functional design. The newspaper no longer holds offices here, but the foyer is well worth a visit if passing, if only to see the newspaper's giant globe sculpture and wall weather stations."
Empire State Building,"A legend from the moment it was finished in 1931, the Empire State Building was easily the tallest building not just in New York, but the entire world for many years before being overtaken by another New York landmark - the twin towers of the World Trade Center. With the destruction of those two buildings, the Empire State Building was once again the tallest building in the city, but that lasted less than eleven years. But even though it's no longer the tallest, it remains iconic and one of the city's biggest tourist attractions. Expect long lines, and a lot of them - you'll have to wait in line to pass through a security checkpoint, wait in line to get tickets, wait in line for the elevators, and then make your way through the crowd on the outdoor observation deck on the 86th floor. One way to deal with the lines is to buy an express line ticket, which will bring you to the front of any line, but it will more than double the cost of your ticket. Another option is to visit very early in the day or late in the evening, when the lines will be considerably shorter. Despite the long lines and inevitable tourist kitsch, the views are excellent and the experience of being outdoors on top of New York City is a great one. Note that hawkers outside the building may try to tell you there is a very long line inside and that they can get you tickets to cut the line for some exorbitant price; before believing them, go inside and check the actual wait time which is clearly written on the electronic boards."
MetLife Building,"Since it was built it has been probably the most hated building in New York, mostly because it rises up over Grand Central Station, completely blocking the view up Park Avenue, but it is a good example of modern architecture."
Rockefeller Center,"The Christmas Tree, the Skating Rink, NBC studios, the shops and hubbub - you can't miss it. The Christmas Tree and the Skating Rink are naturally not year round, but in the summer, the complex is a hub for touristy operations. Within the striking Art Deco buildings of the complex are several dining establishments overlooking the area and many stores."
Radio City Music Hall,"See the Rockettes, another show, or just tour the famous Art Deco masterpiece."

United Nations Headquarters,"The UN HQ sits on an 18-acre site between 42nd and 48th Streets, and between First Avenue and the East River. It is noted for its gardens and outdoor sculpture. There is a charge for the tours of the General Assembly and Secretariat but you can visit the Visitor's Lobby for free (although you do have to pass through a security checkpoint). There are two levels to the lobby area which includes a gallery, a gift shop, and a bookshop. If just visiting the lobby, don't join any queues once you're in the lobby - just find your way around. There is little in the way of signs to tell you where you can go - this is the UN, well-meaning but not well organized."

Museum of Modern Art,"One of the greatest and most popular collections of modern art, on a par with the Tate Modern in London or Paris's Centre Georges Pompidou. Exceedingly popular so be warned: queues for tickets start early and stretch long. To avoid the crowds, turn up at the door at least a half hour before opening, then take the elevator to the top floor and work your way down. The building is as much a draw as the outstanding collection; possessing arguably the best collection of modern masterpieces world-wide, MoMA houses important art works from Van Gogh, Picasso, Monet, Matisse, Salvador Dalí, Paul Cézanne, Frida Kahlo, Piet Mondrian, and works by leading American artists such as Jackson Pollock, Jasper Johns, Edward Hopper, Andy Warhol, and Chuck Close.

Tickets generally run for about $20 a night, and include a free pitcher of beer. Shows run up until as late as 11PM and are a great way for you to end your evening."
B.B. King Blues Club & Grill,"A phenomenal place with one of the widest varieties of music in town, featuring cover bands and soul tributes which fill the gaps between big-name bookings such as Chuck Berry and Solomon Burke. Lately, the club has also shown an interest in extreme-metal bands such as Obituary and Dark Funeral and hip-hop acts such as the Lox and Kool Keith. For many shows, the best seats are at the dinner tables up front, but the menu prices can get pretty expensive and the food is not very good - best to stick to unmixed drinks and have only the simplest food, if necessary. On Sundays, B.B.’s has the Harlem Gospel Choir come in and has a buffet brunch."
NIT,"One of the world's most famous and busiest arenas, Madison Square Garden is home to the New York Rangers NHL team, the New York Knicks NBA team, the New York Liberty WNBA team, and the St. John's Red Storm college men's basketball team, as well as numerous concerts and entertainment events. In addition to most St. John's home games, the Garden also hosts three major college men's basketball events each year. At the start of the season, the Garden hosts the semifinals and finals of the NIT Season Tip-Off, a prestigious early-season event operated by the country's main college sports body, the NCAA. After the regular season, the Garden then hosts the Big East Conference Men's Basketball Tournament in early March, which determines the conference's automatic representative in the wildly popular NCAA tournament. Finally, in late March, the Garden hosts the semifinals and finals of the National Invitation Tournament (NIT), a tournament that the NCAA operates as something of a consolation prize for teams that do not make the NCAA tournament."
B&H,"Perhaps the best camera and photography equipment store in New York, this is the place to go for any of the cameras and camera accessories you might want. The selection is good and the staff is knowledgeable and willing to discuss things with you. It is owned and heavily staffed by Hasidic Jews, so it is closed on Friday nights, Saturdays, and all Jewish holidays except for Hanukkah. B&H provides its holiday closing schedule here."
Hershey's Times Square,"You are able to purchase all types of chocolate goodies and Hershey-themed products at this store. A few dollars can also get you a personalized message scrolled across their zipper outside on the store's facade. Hershey stores are all over the country but this particular store is the largest Hershey's store in the world. It has three floors of pure chocolate, and Hershey's products."
Macy's,"Billing itself as ""The World's Largest Store"" on the large signs outside, this is the flagship store of the national chain and covers an entire city block. Its holiday window displays are so popular that they usually have a corporate sponsor. One useful tip for visitors is to go to the Macy's guest center on floor 1 1/2 and they will give you a guest card that discounts virtually everything in the store by 11%."
Kinokuniya Bookstore,"A Japanese book dealer, carrying a huge selection of Japanese reading material. It also sells a number of books by Japanese authors in English translation. It is also known as a source of excellent Japanese anime and manga, much of which is difficult or impossible to find anywhere else in the United States."
M&M's World New York,You can purchase all types of M&M goodies and M&M-themed trinkets here.
Midtown Comics,"An absolutely gigantic comic book store, one of the largest and most well-known in the country, with two full floors of comics, collectibles, manga, and back issues, as well as a very knowledgeable staff. Signings by giants in the comic book industry are a regular occurrence here and the store also sponsors the annual New York Comic Con held every October. Smaller locations can be found in Midtown East and the Financial District."
Sephora,One-stop shopping for cosmetics.
Cranberry Cafe,"A huge variety of sandwiches, pizza, sushi, and udon. Hot and cold salad bars. Sandwiches are $4-$6. Very popular with local workers, so it gets very busy at breakfast and lunch time. There is ample seating upstairs."
Poseidon Bakery,"Serves wonderful Greek pastries, savory and sweet alike. There is no place to sit, but the staff are very friendly and helpful, and you can have a delicious, cheap meal for takeout."
The Halal Guys,"An extremely popular and affordable food stand that is probably the only Mediterranean stand in all of Manhattan that was actually given a name. This is the original location and since it started in 2008, it has begun a chain and opened 5 more throughout Manhattan and Bergen County, NJ. Delicious gyros, wraps, and falafel, and each dish comes with rice and pita bread. There's also an incredible white sauce that's worth trying. Note that if you want some on a weekend, you're going to have to get there early because there is guaranteed to be a long wait."
The Original Soup Man,"Inspiration for the Soup Nazi from ""Seinfeld"". Menu items change daily. The best soup in the area, but ONLY if you follow the rules! ""NO SOUP FOR YOU!"""
Ariana Afghan Kabob,"Very good food, which of course includes kebabs, but also peppery Aush (a type of beany noodle soup), Badinjan Burani (a fried eggplant appetizer garlic and yogurt, served with bread), etc. Salads, which come with main dishes, have a dressing which includes mayonnaise. Ask for no dressing and put the green hot sauce on them yourself."
Dos Caminos,"Dos Caminos' fifth New York City location. Designed by Brooklyn-based company, hOmE, spanning two floors, and featuring a 40-seat mezcal and margarita bar on the street level and a guacamole bar on the subterranean level. Expanded menu of Chef Ivy Stark’s healthy Mexican dishes as well as a selection of 120 premium tequilas."
Gazala Place,"Dependably delicious Israeli Druze cuisine. Their babaganush is categorically better than at most other places, with great smokiness. Their special meze platter, which is not on the menu but seems to always be available, is a fair deal at $20-something. The restaurant is a bit cramped, especially when you have to walk through the kitchen to the restroom, but for food this good at these kinds of prices this close to Times Square and helpful service, it's really worthwhile."
John's Pizzeria,"A popular pizza option with a lovely and spacious atmosphere and brick oven, coal fired, thin crust pizzas. Whole pies, no slices. Many fans, however, observe that the pizza at this location is not nearly as good as at their original Greenwich Village location. Also, pre-theater, it can be absolutely mobbed, with wait times of an hour or more."
Ocha Sushi,Japanese restaurant with good sushi.
Vice Versa,"Simple, but tasty Italian fare."
Westway Diner,"Real New York diner, excellent place for good value breakfast. Very good service."
Wondee Siam,"Small restaurant, so expect to wait on line at peak hours (e.g., Friday and Saturday nights); generally considered to be one of the best Thai restaurants in Manhattan. Food ranges in spiciness from mild to very spicy, not always consistent with what you ask for, but staff are happy to provide extra dried red pepper flakes on the side. Consistently tasty food, especially if you stick with the items on the ""secret Thai"" menu card on the table and ask for everything to be ""very spicy and Thai style, not sweet."""
Abigael's On Broadway,"Kosher. The main restaurant is downstairs, where the quiet atmosphere is a nice break from the vibrancy of the area. Service can be slow, but it's great for a long, relaxed dinner to end off an exciting day."
Aureole,"Kosher. The main restaurant is downstairs, where the quiet atmosphere is a nice break from the vibrancy of the area. Service can be slow, but it's great for a long, relaxed dinner to end off an exciting day."

McGee's Restaurant and Pub,"This is an unpretentious pub in the middle of a pricey neighborhood. The prices are very inexpensive for the neighborhood, and the pub also provides downright good food. Service is pleasant and helpful."
The Perfect Pint,"Two-story pub off of Times Square with good Irish beers on tap and pricey entrées. Definitely not typical pub-grub, but the price matches."
Hotel Carter,Offering 700 lodging accommodations all with private bath. Close-up view of the ball drop at New Times Square.
Hotel Pennsylvania,"Large hotel, landmark, near all the action in the area. Once a luxury hotel built by the Pennsylvania Railroad at the time of its opening in 1919, it has sadly fallen upon hard times since the collapse of the railway company, and these days functions as a budget hotel. As low as $99/night. Restaurants, café, fitness centre, meeting facilities for 10 to 1000. Pet friendly. There is a $4 charge for each piece of luggage stored and be warned, cleanliness is not a high point."

Hudson Hotel,"A fashionably trendy upmarket boutique hotel which is great for celeb spotting. Rooms are comparatively tiny with little storage space, so think again if you travel with a big wardrobe. Otherwise, the subdued lighting, designer fittings, and relatively lower prices tend to attract a younger vibey crowd, especially to the über-trendy bar at the foyer level."
InterContinental New York Times Square,"A fashionably trendy upmarket boutique hotel which is great for celeb spotting.

Wall Street,"The historic heart of the Financial District and the home of the New York Stock Exchange, Wall Street is a byword for American big business and stock trading (most New York financial firms are no longer headquartered on the street itself, but housed nearby in new offices). A narrow street running downhill from Broadway to the East River, Wall Street was named for the wall that was built here in 1652 to keep Manhattan's indigenous peoples out of the growing Dutch settlement. The wall was demolished by the British in 1699. By the late 18th century, traders and speculators would gather under a buttonwood tree at the foot of Wall Street to trade informally - this was the origin of the New York Stock Exchange that was established in 1817."
New York Stock Exchange,"A historic site, not least because of the Black Thursday crash of the Exchange on 24 October 1929 and the subsequent sell-off panic which started on Black Tuesday, 29 October, precipitating the worldwide Great Depression of the early 1930s. The present Exchange building opened in 1903, recognized from the first as an example of masterful architecture, with the six massive Corinthian columns across its Broad Street facade imparting a feeling of substance and stability and, to many, seeming the very embodiment of America’s growth and prosperity. The building has been closed to the public since 9/11."
23 Wall Street,"Located across from the Stock Exchange is this imposing office building which was constructed in 1914 and served as the headquarters of JP Morgan. The Wall Street Bombing of September 16, 1920 damaged the building, with shrapnel blasting several holes in the limestone facade. The holes are still there for any to see."
Trump Building,"A very impressive skyscraper which was completed in 1930 and surpassed the height of the nearby Woolworth Building, making it the tallest building in the world until the Chrysler Building was completed just a month later (which in turn lost that title to the Empire State Building less than a year later). The building was purchased by Donald Trump in 1995, hence its current name."
Federal Hall,"On this site on April 30, 1789, George Washington stood on a balcony overlooking Wall Street and was inaugurated as the first president of the United States. The old building on the site had been used as New York's city hall and had hosted some of the first congregations of the colonies in the lead-up to the American Revolution, such as the Stamp Act Congress. After the revolution the building, now Federal Hall, briefly housed Congress, the Supreme Court, and Executive Branch offices before the national capital moved to Philadelphia. The current building dates to 1842 and was used first as a Customs House, then later the US Sub-Treasury (millions of dollars of gold and silver were kept in the basement vaults). Today the building is maintained by the National Park Service as a museum dedicated to the history of the site. Guided tours of the building are available, or you can just walk in and look up at the rotunda and view some of the artifacts, such as the bible Washington used in his inauguration ceremony."
Trinity Church,"An Episcopalian (Anglican) church and parish was first established on this site in 1697 under charter by King William III. The present Neo-Gothic Revival church building (the third incarnation) dates from 1846 and remains a significant landmark within Downtown. The original burial ground at Trinity Church includes the graves and memorials of many historic figures, including Alexander Hamilton, William Bradford, Robert Fulton, and Albert Gallatin."
Bowling Green,"A small park at the foot of Broadway which is the oldest public park in the city and is the site of the Charging Bull sculpture created after the 1987 stock market crash. Bowling Green is also the origin point for the Broadway ticker-tape parades; if you walk up Broadway, you can view plaques in the sidewalk honoring the people or events celebrated in these parades."
The Sphere,"At the southern tip of Manhattan, Battery Park is a waterfront green space, named for the artillery batteries which were installed here to protect the settlement of New York when it was under Dutch, then British rule. In the lead-up to the War of 1812, 40.70343-74.016829 Castle Clinton was constructed as a fort to protect the city, and is now operated as a small museum. There are several memorials in the park, including 40.70387-74.0172710 The Sphere, a public art piece originally housed on the World Trade Center site which survived the events of September 11 and was moved to Battery Park. Ferries departing to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island (see below) depart from here."
National September 11 Memorial & Museum,"On the site of the former World Trade Center towers, the memorial consists of two enormous waterfalls and reflecting pools set within the footprints of the twin towers, lined with bronze panels with the names of the nearly 3,000 victims of that fateful day inscribed. The surrounding plaza holds a grove of trees. The museum, which sits underground right next to the memorial, contains exhibits which explain the events of 9/11 and their aftermath, with remnants of the original towers and artifacts from that day."
One World Trade Center,"Recently completed, the new One World Trade Center skyscraper rises 1,776 feet above the street and is the tallest building in the United States (and for that matter, the Western Hemisphere). Despite its colossal size, its simple design allows it to blend remarkably well into the Lower Manhattan skyline. A newly-opened observation deck on the top floors offers 360-degree views of the city."
St Paul's Chapel,"Built in 1776, the chapel is an active part of the Parish of Trinity Church and is Manhattan's oldest public building in continuous use. It is the only remaining colonial church in New York City and was George Washington's place of worship after he was inaugurated as president, but more recently the chapel became known for surviving the events of 9/11 without even a broken window - despite being located across the street from the World Trade Center - and its role as a place of refuge for the WTC recovery workers in the days that followed."
Woolworth Building,"One of the oldest and most famous of New York's skyscrapers (dubbed the ""Cathedral of Commerce""), the neo-Gothic Woolworth Building was completed in 1913 and was the world's tallest building until 1930. The building has a beautiful ornate lobby. Tours are offered most days. Pre-registration is required."
New York by Gehry,"A recent addition to the Lower Manhattan skyline, this 76-story residential skyscraper by the noted Frank Gehry has a distinctive rippled, ""wavy"" facade that is quite eye-catching. It is best viewed from City Hall Park and the Brooklyn Bridge."
Tweed Courthouse,"On a triangular city block between Broadway, Park Row and Chambers Street sits City Hall, a gorgeous gleaming white building completed in 1812 and still serves as the home of certain city government functions, such as the office of the mayor. The building itself is fenced off and only accessible by tour, but there is a lovely park surrounding the building, with plenty of shady trees and a pleasant fountain just to the south of the building. Just north of City Hall and on the same block is the 40.71337-74.0055517 Tweed Courthouse, a gorgeous government structure and the legacy of Tammany Hall boss William M. Tweed, who used the courthouse project to embezzle large sums of money from the city budget and was convicted in a courtroom in this building."
Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall,"The original subway station, and quite a marvel to witness--the chandeliers and ornate tiling are a sharp contrast to the nearby Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall station. There's one catch, though: it's been closed since 1945. However, you can see it by staying on the downtown 6 train after its last stop Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall; it will turn around in the old station. This is the one place in the system where this is allowed, and the announcements reflect that. The Transit Museum (in Downtown Brooklyn) offers occasional tours as well, which allow you to actually walk around the station, but you must be a museum member and a US citizen, making this an impractical choice for most visitors."
Manhattan Municipal Building,"With New York City growing and not enough space in the City Hall building, this 40-story structure was built to meet the space demands of the city government. Completed in 1915, it is a massive and very grand building with the gilded statue of a woman standing atop the building's spire."
Brooklyn Bridge,"From its intersection with Park Row (just east of City Hall) you can walk (takes about 20-30 minutes each way), bike, or drive across the historic and iconic bridge to Brooklyn. The view from the bridge is quite lovely, with excellent views of Lower Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn and good views of Midtown and the New York Harbor in the distance."
African Burial Ground National Monument,"For most of the 18th century, Africans in New York City were buried in a graveyard outside the city. The graveyard was eventually forgotten and was rediscovered in 1991. This museum and memorial site commemorate the estimated 15,000 Africans that were interred on the site of the memorial. Note that the museum is located inside of a Federal building so airport-style security should be expected."
Museum of American Finance,"A small museum dedicated to finance and the markets, with exhibits that change periodically."
Museum of Jewish Heritage,A memorial to the Holocaust.
National Museum of the American Indian,"Housed in the Alexander Hamilton US Custom House, this Smithsonian museum is the New York branch of the National Museum of the American Indian (the other branches are in Washington, D.C. and Maryland)."

crown,"A gift from the people of France to celebrate the centennial of the United States, stands upon Liberty Island and is one of the most famous symbols of the nation and has been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list. Upon departing the ferry, you can visit the Visitor Information Station, which has a schedule of the day's events. Visitors can also meet at the Liberty Island Flagpole (behind the statue) for a ranger-led tour of the island. You can also visit the monument lobby, museum (where you'll see various exhibits on the statue, the old torch, and the famous ""New Colossus"" sonnet), and outside to the promenade and Fort Wood (the 11-point star-shaped structure the statue stands upon). You can also take a trip to the pedestal observation deck (though not up into the statue itself, unless you have a Reserve with Crown ticket); visitors can look upward to view the interior of the statue (there are four marked viewing locations); and the pedestal observation deck provides a 360-degree view, which includes the New York City skyline. Security checks are rigorous, so travel as light as possible. Backpacks and other large bags are not permitted on the tours but can be stored in lockers for a fee. On busy days there may be long waits. Visitors with the Reserve with Crown ticket are allowed to climb up a circular staircase from the base of the statue to the crown, but tickets are very limited and should be reserved three or four months (up to one year) in advance. Children must be at least 4-feet tall, and must be able to walk up and down the stairs by themselves, and all ticket holders must show a photo ID to match the name on their tickets."
American Family Immigration History Center,"Ellis Island was home to the nation's primary federal immigration station, with over 12 million immigrant steamship passengers passing through from its opening in 1892 to its closing in 1954. Today, over 40 percent of America's population can trace their ancestry through Ellis Island. The island is home to the American Family Immigration History Center, which contains manifests of 25 million immigrants, passengers, and crew members who entered New York Harbor. The Immigration museum at Ellis Islands has details about ""Peopling of America"" and if you are an avid history lover, this museum will need at least 3-4 hrs of your time. Since the ferry ride takes you to both Ellis Island as well as the Liberty Island, you will have to plan your day well."

Bill’s Bar & Burger,"Classic American fare, includes handmade griddle burgers, milkshakes and a wide beer selection."

There are various artworks on display in the museum, with the Unicorn Tapestries being the most famous."
Dyckman Farmhouse,"The former residence of William Dyckman, who owned several hundred acres of farmland covering much of what is now Inwood and Washington heights. Nestled incongruously at the otherwise unremarkable corner of 204th and Broadway, the farmhouse has been converted into a small museum of life in early Manhattan and hosts various programs for the neighborhood.

Strivers Row,Million-dollar homes in an unlikely neighborhood.
Theresa Tower,"This New York City landmark started accepting black guests in 1940, becoming one of the few hotels in the city to do so. This led it to become a mixing point for notable African Americans of the time, and through the 40s and 50s it was the center of black Harlem social community. It also gained notoriety when Fidel Castro chose to stay here for the 1960 UN General Assembly. Its ornamentation makes it one of the most visually striking buildings in Northern Manhattan."

The Firetower, a landmark 1857 building, is the only surviving example of nineteenth century fire watchtowers."
Riverside Park,A riverfront park providing pleasant views of New Jersey and sometimes breezes off the river. Summer brings al fresco movies and music to the park.
Amateur Night at the Apollo,"The legendary Apollo Theater, ""where stars are born and legends made"", is a source of pride for Harlem, and a symbol of American artistic achievement. The Apollo is best known for its world-famous Amateur Night at the Apollo, which launched the careers of legendary artists like Ella Fitzgerald, James Brown, Michael Jackson, D'Angelo and Lauryn Hill. The Apollo remains the nation's most popular arena for emerging and established black and Latino performers."
Amateur Night at the Apollo,"Amateur Night at the Apollo celebrated its 75th Anniversary in 2009 as the quintessential talent competition, serving as the model for Star Search and American Idol. Competitions are held nearly every Wednesday evening throughout the year, culminating with the ""Super Top Dog"" competition. The show marries world-class talent with a distinctive, vaudeville-like atmosphere, and has depended on audience participation since the very beginning. The popularity contest has proven an effective measure of star potential, becoming a launch pad for some of the nation's greatest entertainers."
Marjorie's Parlor Jazz,"One of the most charmingly intimate jazz venues anywhere is simply Marjorie Eliot's apartment in Harlem. It's somewhat a jam session, although there are regulars, drawing an attentive and eclectic crowd including music students from China, neighbors from the building, and everyone in between. Seating is first come, first served, so it does make sense to be there by 4PM. As friendly and hospitable as it gets, people will come around with cookies and juice during breaks. Note that getting off the subway at 155th St will require a long, steep climb up steps to get from lower 155th to Edgecombe."
Fairway,"Fairway is a quality discount supermarket that's well-known in the New York area. Their humongous Harlem location is in an out-of-the-way location that isn't convenient to any subway stop, as it is quite a bit west and somewhat uptown from the #1 stop at 125th St. and Broadway — not very convenient if you are carrying a lot of heavy groceries — and no bus stops really close by, either (the closest you can get is 125th St. and 12th Ave., via the Bx15 limited bus on weekdays and regular bus on weekends). Most of the people who shop at this location probably drive cars, and the store's website promotes the fact that it is near the 125th St. exit from the Henry Hudson Parkway (and therefore convenient for people who work in New York City and want to buy some produce before taking the George Washington Bridge home to New Jersey). However, if you spend more than $200, they guarantee free delivery between 86th and 220th Sts., east and west sides (it costs $7.95 otherwise), and they also offer a free shuttle for groups of 10 or more people, by reservation, with pickup and delivery from and to 64th-181st and 12th Avenue-York Avenue."
Amy Ruth's,"Classic, tasty soul food, friendly service."
El Malecon,"A Dominican restaurant famous for its pollo a la brasa (rotisserie chicken) has its flagship in this neighborhood. Go there and enjoy the food, the fresh-squeezed juice, and the Latin music on the jukebox."
El Presidente,"Offers another take on Dominican food, with good pork-stuffed plantains, guinea hen stew (an occasional special) and, oddly, a terrific Cuban sandwich."
Mike's Bagels,Fresh bagels made in-house daily.
Patsy's Pizzeria,"This is great old-school New York coal-oven pizza. Don't go overboard on the toppings, which are not the reason why you should go there. Get a plain pizza, and enjoy the wonder of a thin, nicely charred crust with delicious sauce and cheese that aren't heaped on but applied judiciously in a style that derives clearly from its origins in Naples. A couple should be able to down a pie or two with some salad without trouble for a meal, because the crust is so thin, but note that you can also get slices for takeout."
Red Rooster,"The new restaurant of Marcus Samuelsson, originally from Ethiopia with adoptive Swedish parents. The cuisine is a mix of different influences, with nods to traditional soul food, classic Swedish fare, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. Tables can be hard to come by without a reservation, and you might not get a friendly hostess, but the restaurant by itself is reason enough to take the trip uptown."
Settepani,"The new restaurant of Marcus Samuelsson, originally from Ethiopia with adoptive Swedish parents. The cuisine is a mix of different influences, with nods to traditional soul food, classic Swedish fare, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. Tables can be hard to come by without a reservation, and you might not get a friendly hostess, but the restaurant by itself is reason enough to take the trip uptown."
Sister's Cuisine,Anglo-Caribbean.
Zoma,"This Ethiopian restaurant is quite arguably the best in the city. Their injera (traditional Ethiopian bread) is more sour than other Ethiopian restaurants in town, and the food is really savory. If you drink, get a bottle of tej (mead) with your meal, as they have a good one. It helps if you like spicy food, as they do not stint on any aspect of flavor. Cash and Amex only; no other credit cards accepted."
Londel's,"This Ethiopian restaurant is quite arguably the best in the city. Their injera (traditional Ethiopian bread) is more sour than other Ethiopian restaurants in town, and the food is really savory. If you drink, get a bottle of tej (mead) with your meal, as they have a good one. It helps if you like spicy food, as they do not stint on any aspect of flavor. Cash and Amex only; no other credit cards accepted."
P. J.'s,"This Ethiopian restaurant is quite arguably the best in the city.

If you drink, get a bottle of tej (mead) with your meal, as they have a good one. It helps if you like spicy food, as they do not stint on any aspect of flavor. Cash and Amex only; no other credit cards accepted."
American Legion Post 398,"Two words sum this place up: juke joint. A real one. It's a dive bar hosted by the local American Legion with basic soul food, good company, and jam sessions three nights a week. Sunday is the night to come if you want to see some really good musicians come in and light up the Hammond organ. F-Sa they have basically an R&B dance party, but as of 2013 the Fridays have become member only (hopefully this policy won't extend to other nights in the future, as this place gets better known outside the neighborhood!). No cover (although you are required to ""sign in"" for some reason), but you will be expected to be spending money: think of it as a vague drink minimum, and order food if you take a table."
Bill's Place,"Bill Saxton, clearly a man destined to play the sax. His Coltrane-like performances are among the best you'll see in the city, but you'll see them here in his own basement apartment with a crowd of just 25 aficionados on a street heavy with jazz history. Unbeknownst to Bill until just recently, his apartment was one of many jazz-filled speakeasies on 133rd, and was in fact where one Billie Holiday got her start and Fats Waller's left hand strode mightily upon the keys. BYOB (and bring cups if you don't want to drink out of the bottle). Make reservations by the kind of confusing process of leaving a voice message (or you could try the less-reliable online form), then show up around 8:30PM and buzz yourself in."
Ginny's Supper Club,"This is the upscale (and pricey) option for live jazz and other music in Harlem, with a beautiful, classy space, room for dancing, and fine dining (think soul food steakhouse with craft cocktails). Sundays see the gospel brunch, for which reservations are a must. Check the calendar for who's playing and dress to impress."
Showman's,"Think Harlem jazz club, and the aesthetic that should come to mind is exactly what you'll find here. A dimly lit bar where music is king. Opposite the 125th St station, it's right at the heart of Harlem. Instead of a cover, there's a two-drink/$14 minimum per person per set."
The Harlem YMCA,Has a Health and Wellness Center and a heated swimming pool.
New York University,"The main campus for NYU is found in Greenwich Village, centered around Washington Square Park."
Washington Square Park,"The park and its famous arch are located in the heart of the Village. Though located in the middle of an affluent neighborhood, the park attracts a hodgepodge of people. During the warmer months of the school term, the park is a favourite hangout spot for students from nearby NYU. Part of the charm of the park is the view of the buildings across the street. All these buildings are now owned by NYU, and though there has been some controversial construction in recent years, most of the stately 19th-century dwellings pictured in the classic movie The Heiress (based on Henry James' novel, Washington Square) are still there for you to enjoy looking at."
Grove Court,"The setting for O'Henry's famous short story, The Last Leaf."
Cherry Lane Theater,"The setting for O'Henry's famous short story, The Last Leaf."
West 4th Street Courts,"Even if you haven't heard of these basketball courts, you've probably seen them in TV commercials and movies, as ""The Cage"" (referring to the small, chain-link fence enclosed court) is the site of many intense, very physical pick-up games and informal ""streetball"" tournament matches. It's not a place to play unless you really know what you're getting into, but it's worth watching if you're interested in a more intense, physical form of basketball."
IFC Center,"An art house theater showing independent films and documentaries. It is owned by the IFC network (an extension of AMC), so a lot of premiers and television broadcasts take place here."
Quad Cinema,"One of the older independent cinemas, showing a regular schedule of independent, foreign and documentary films."
Angelika Film Center,"Just down the street from Film Forum, the Angelika plays new independent and foreign films, many of which are screened in no American city but New York. The cafe upstairs is something of a hotspot as well."
Cinema Village,"Cinema Village specializes in showing documentaries, independent and foreign films. Often the films there will not be playing anywhere else in the country and Q&As with directors are common at opening weekends."
Village Vanguard,Presents a great lineup of jazz performers in a quiet room (except for the music) that has good acoustics.
Blue Note,Also has a lineup of famous jazz and blues performers. It feels a little more like a bar (with people talking during the show) and a little less like a venue that's only about the music.
Small's,A great place to hear excellent jazz at low prices.
55 Bar,"This bar has some good blues and jazz acts, but what's so unusual about it is that it dates back to 1919 and still has a lot of the original furnishings and Beaux Arts-style lamps. Keep your drink orders simple and enjoy the atmosphere."
Generation Records,"Best place in the city to buy hardcore, metal, industrial, punk, and alternative records."
Three Lives & Company,"A local independent bookstore, this microscopic yet utterly delightful place is the essence of Greenwich Village, with an extremely knowledgeable and passionate staff."
Warehouse Wines and Spirits,"Generally quite inexpensive wines and liquors, good recommendations and fast service."
Arturo's,"A popular local pizza restaurant with an ""old-time"" theme, serving coal oven pizza with a lightly charred, crispy crust. There is live jazz there every night."
Babbo,"The most famous of Chef Mario Batali's restaurants, and especially well-known for its pasta tasting menu. Reserve a month in advance or stand on line before opening time (5:30PM on weekdays and 5:00PM on Sundays) to try to get a seat at the bar or one of the tables kept open for walk-ins. Babbo is one of the hardest restaurants to get a reservation at in New York, which should indicate something about its popularity. Do not expect a cheap meal, but this is one you don't have to dress up for."
Blue Hill,An upscale American restaurant known for its fresh ingredients and subtlety. Call ahead for reservations.
Joe's Pizza,"A very popular corner pizza joint that serves huge, thin crust slices fresh out of the oven. This is classic New York fast food - service is quick but the place is tiny, so you'll want to take your slice outside to eat."
John's Pizzeria,"A classic New York pizza place - a gritty joint with brick oven, thin crust pizza. The lines are often long but the service is fast. Whole pies only, no slices. Cash and travelers checks only."
Lupa Osteria Romana,"This is yet another restaurant associated with Mario Batali, but the Executive Chef is Steve Connaughton. This is a good and sometimes very good, relatively informal, mid-priced eatery, with a good and fair-priced wine list, though the food can be overly salty at times. Every fan has their own favorite dishes. First-timers may want to share several smaller dishes instead of having full meals, in order to sample the cuisine, but the primi and secondi are also worthy. The excellent Tartufo is their best dessert. Reservations recommended; otherwise, you may have a long wait."
Mamoun's Falafel,A hole in the wall place that serves arguably the most famous falafels in New York City.
Murray's Bagels,"This is a place that believes in the pure New York bagel — which means no toasting. Don't even bother asking. But the bagels are so fresh that it doesn't matter. It's often packed with long lines and the service is chaotic, but they give you a healthy amount of spread and toppings."
Otto,"The pizzeria in the Batali chain. Prices are much cheaper here than at Babbo, but the entire concept of the restaurant is different, so take it for what it is. The antipasti are great and the gelati as well as the pizza are well thought of. Good pasta dishes, too. Though the food is very good, the restaurant can be deafeningly loud, especially if you are in or close to the bar."
Percy's Pizza,Pizza for minimalists. Percy's is a favorite among the collection of one-dollar pizza slice joints in the city. Inside is a cozy little room with about eight seats and a nice pizza cook. Know what you want when you step up to order and avoid trying to sit with any large groups; you'll quickly fill up the whole place.
Red Bamboo,"Excellent vegetarian soul food, organic wines."
Strip House,"Strip House is a privately owned fine dining chain of steakhouses. All locations have smaller, separate rooms for private dining and a gift card program. Strip House Next Door is next door at 11 East 12th Street. Similar hours and menu but closed Sunday & Monday."
Tea and Sympathy,"Describes itself as ""a quintessential corner of England in the heart of Greenwich Village"", typically English meals are available here (perfect for the Anglophile or homesick Brit!)"
Three Sheets Saloon,"Describes itself as ""a quintessential corner of England in the heart of Greenwich Village"", typically English meals are available here (perfect for the Anglophile or homesick Brit!)"
Stonewall Inn,"A veritable icon of the worldwide gay community, not just New York's. While it's not the original incarnation of the bar that was the site of the Stonewall riots of 1969 (the building has gone through several uses since then), the current incarnation pays homage to the old and has regained its prominence as a meeting place in the LGBT community."
Washington Square Hotel,"This hotel offers art deco styled furnishings and complimentary internet access at the lobby bar and considers itself a haven for writers, artists and visitors."
Jefferson Market Library,"Like other branches of the New York Public Library, they have Wi-Fi and computers for public use, among other services. The building, formerly used as a courthouse, is a unique, fanciful neo-Gothic structure well worth looking at even if you don't plan on patronizing the library."
The Wall,"A 1973 piece of minimalist artwork - actually, ranging for 8 stories, quite large rather than minimal - by Forrest Myers graces the blind wall of the building at 599 Broadway. It has actually been removed and rebuilt in the 2000s because of its impact on the wall it is placed on, placed higher to allow for street-level advertising below it. Because of its prominent location at the intersection of Broadway and Houston Street, it is often referred to as marking the Gateway to Soho."
E. V. Haughwout Building,"One of the finest examples of the cast-iron-facade buildings that SoHo is famous for. Built in 1857, it is considered as one of the first buildings where the cast-iron structure was left uncovered and rather shaped into the ornamental form replacing a traditional brick, stone or plaster facade. Mr Haughwout ran a tableware emporium sprawling over the building's five stories, famous far beyond the city to the extent that it was there where Mary Todd Lincoln purchased new china for the White House. The emporium also provided customers with a convenience that was a world first - a passenger elevator by Elisha Otis, soon to become a de rigeur amenity of all new buildings in New York."
Children's Museum of the Arts,Art and interactive exhibits geared towards children.
New York City Fire Museum,"Housed in a restored 1904 firehouse, the NYC Fire Museum covers the history of fire fighting in the United States from the 18th century to the present. Displays include antique aparatus, uniforms and equipment, as well as an apartment fire simulator."
Sonnabend Gallery,"Specializes in contemporary art including paintings, sculptures, and photography by American and European artists. Past artists have included: Lawrence Beck, Robert Feintuch, Jeff Koons, Grazia Toderi, Philip Haas, Barry Le Va, Anne and Patrick Poirier, and more."
Film Forum,"A stylish theater that runs two programs—contemporary independent releases and classic repertory films. While the current releases are almost always interesting and worth seeing, it's the repertory programming schedule that filmlovers anticipate eagerly."
Here Arts Center,Performing arts venue.
The Performing Garage,Off-Broadway theater that is the permanent home of experimental theater company the Wooster Group.
Kee's Chocolates,"Kee is widely considered by chocolate-lovers to be one of the best artisanal chocolatiers in New York. Anyone who likes chocolate will find some of her creations interesting and enjoyable. Among her truffles are balsamic, fennel, smoked salt, and Thai chili, as well as less unusual flavors like almond and hazelnut praline."
McNally Jackson Books,"Formerly McNally Robinson Booksellers, this independent bookstore features an extensive collection of magazines, fiction, and nonfiction. The store also features a cafe, as well as a number of ongoing events, signings, book clubs and discussion groups."
Pearl River Mart,"Vast store of Chinese and other Asian goods: kitchenware, traditional clothing, home furnishing, tea."
Uniqlo,A Japanese clothing store for men and women. This location used to be the retail chain's only North American store.
LF Stores,"LF Stores is not very big or well known, but it carries some unique items, such that celebrities have shopped here. The prices are a little bit on the high side, depending on the item - for example, shirts cost about $50-$200. The service is wonderful, and the staff is very helpful. Aside from clothing, there are such accessories as jewelry, scarfs, hats, and shoes. The outside of the narrow building is tan, and there is a doorman."
Topshop,"Topshop is a women's clothing store that carries all types of clothing. It carries maternity clothing, designers, boutiques, and all sizes. The clothing is really fashion forward, and there have accessories.  The main warehouse is in England.  You can buy online or go to the store, which has two floors and an escalator. The prices vary, but they tend to run a little bit more on the high side. Items mostly vary from around $50-$90."
Balthazar,"Balthazar has the feel and quality of a good Parisian brasserie. Though informal and relaxed in feel, it is not inexpensive; however, many New Yorkers and visitors alike find it a worthwhile experience. Brunch is especially popular there, so unless you plan to show up for an early breakfast, make sure you make reservations; you don't want to be one of the people waiting on line for an hour or more, just to get in."
Dos Caminos,"One of four up-market Mexican restaurants in Manhattan by the same name and under the same ownership (the other's are in Gramercy, Chelsea, Midtown East) Sticky, saucy ribs and guacamole."
Famous Ben's Pizza,"Famous Ben's Pizza is one of the oldest and best pizza places in SoHo. Some people get taken on a pizza tour here. It is a small place with few tables, but the environment fits New York perfectly. You can watch as they make the pizza, and lines are usually out the door. Their pizza doesn't cost a lot. If you are just looking for a quick and simple meal while you are out shopping, Famous Ben's is a great place to consider. They deliver, too."
The Ear Inn,"Located on the ground floor of the James Brown House, the Ear Inn is one of the oldest bars in New York."
Soho Grand Hotel,"The Soho Grand Hotel is a pet-friendly boutique hotel, featuring 353 guest rooms, ten suites, and two sprawling penthouses."

Saint-Petersburg Trade & Publishing House,"Russian books, CDs, DVDs, and more."

Nathan's Original,"Opened in 1905, this store offers great hot dogs, fries, grilled chicken, etc. Prices are somewhat high, with a hot dog costing $3.25"
Taci's Beyti,"Well-priced, fantastic Turkish restaurant located in Gravesend. Fast service; BYOB. Worth the trip, and a good opportunity to explore other areas of Brooklyn if you're staying in the Slope or the Heights."
Totonno's,"A family brick oven pizzeria that's been continually operating since 1905. The crust is one of the very best around - thin, crisp, and charred with a sweet sauce. Whole pies only, no slices. A few blocks from the Coney Island boardwalk. Cash only."

P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center,"Supported by the Museum of Modern Art, this innovative (and cheap) contemporary art museum is in a former public school building. The conversion left most of the original features of the school - the large ex-classrooms are perfect for installations - and the bathrooms are a blast from the past. P.S.1 is a few blocks south on Jackson Avenue from the Citibank tower; the entrance is a concrete slab (how fitting) which occludes view of the school itself. P.S.1 also has a nice cafe and outdoor seats where every able-bodied New Yorker can enjoy a smoke."
Steinway & Sons Pianos,"They offer free guided tours during fall and spring to see the skilled craftsmen at work. Phone ahead, a month in advance is recommended, to reserve a place on these popular tours, and to check the days and times. Otherwise, take the online factory tour on their website."
New York Hall of Science Farmers' Market,"111th St and 48th Ave off Corona Ave. Wednesday, 10AM-3:00PM, June to November."
Jamaica Farmers' Market,"160th St. off Jamaica Ave. Friday and Saturday, 8:30AM-4PM, June to November."
Unisphere,"The site of the 1939 and 1964 World's Fairs. The area around the park still includes some architectural and artistic relics of the events (including the Unisphere, a 300 ton spherical grid of steel, the world's largest globe, as featured in ""Men In Black""). The park is very expansive, so be prepared to walk, or rent a bike near the Passarelle Building at the north entrance. The park also includes:"
New York Hall of Science,"Originally a pavilion for the 1964 World's Fair, this science center is now full of hands-on exhibits for the public. Highlights include Sports Challenge, Rocket Park (featuring full sized Atlas and Titan tickets), and a science playground."
Queens Botanical Garden,"Large garden and arboretum featuring a variety of plants, and also a Victorian-style wedding garden."
Queens Museum of Art,A visual arts center featuring the Panorama of New York City; a large architectural scale model NYC.
Queens Zoo,"An 11-acre zoo featuring over 40 wildlife species including bison, mountain lions, and bears."
U.S. Open,"Home of the U.S. Open and also the largest public tennis facility in the world. It features 3 stadium courts, 9 indoor courts, and 14 outdoor courts which are available to the public year-round."
New York Mets,"Built in 2009, the Mets' new ballpark has a unique architectural entrance which pays homage to the design of Ebbets Field, mimicking the old architecture of the Brooklyn Dodgers' ballpark with its arched facade. The name of the entrance, the Jackie Robinson Rotunda, honors the first black player in modern Major League Baseball, who played for the Brooklyn Dodgers at Ebbets Field. A museum dedicated to the Mets is next to the rotunda and open on game days. If the Mets hit a home run, look for the Home Run Apple rising out of the center field wall; if you're not so lucky (this is the Mets, after all), you can still view the Home Run Apple from the now-demolished Shea Stadium between Citi Field and the 7 subway station.Unfortunately, there isn't much to do surrounding the stadium, so anybody looking for post-game activities will have to take the 7 train to other parts of Queens or go into Manhattan. The surrounding area of Willets Point is infamously home to a cluster of chop shops. However, plans for development and neighborhood revitalization are underway. Tickets range from $12 for outfield seats to over $100 for a seat behind home plate. "
A & C Supermarket,"This is positively the biggest Chinese supermarket in New York. There are several other large Chinese supermarkets in the neighborhood, but A & C is by far the best for most purposes. You want it, they've got it. A & C is patronized extensively not only by members of the Chinese community, but also by Indians and Anglos, because it has high-quality fresh produce, all sorts of condiments, meats, poultry, fish and seafood, prepared goods, etc."
Spicy and Tasty,"Spicy and Tasty used to be arguably the best Sichuan-style restaurant in New York, but they have changed management, and recent reports have been mixed."
Lu's Seafood,"A popular Taiwanese restaurant. They serve thick and thin soups which are big enough for a meal with or without a cold dish. For those who want it, there is offal available, notably including pig intestine dishes."
East Manor,"A Zagat Survey rated restaurant that serves some of the best Chinese, Korean, and Japanese food in New York City. This restaurant is often packed during the weekdays, and serves many lunch and diner specials. A buffet room is located on the top floor. It can be on the pricey side for weekends, but much cheaper than Manhattan."
Sunway,"Delicious dim sum all day as well as a full menu. Come for the dim sum, stay for the specialty drinks with fun names."
AA Plaza,"Serves fast and inexpensive take-out food for commuters. The scallion pancakes ($1) are particularly good. No seating - eat on your feet, or if the weather permits, sit on the steps of the public library across the street."
Hunan House,"Authentic, very tasty and spicy Hunanese food in a quiet, historical part of Flushing about a half mile from the subway stop. Expect to spend about $20/person for a large dinner, and to leave with your mouth buzzing."
El Rincón Antioqueño,"Specializes in Colombian cuisine, particularly of the region of Medellín."
Fu Run,"Fairly cheap place to try Chinese Muslim food, particularly from the Northeast. They have all the standard offerings (including, somewhat surprisingly, a large pork selection), but the standout is the lamb dishes. Try lamb's kidney if you're adventurous."
Sushi Village,"Asian restaurant which makes a little pricey sushi and other Asian goods, but all keeps it nice. Service is kinda slow. Think the restaurant's full? Think again! This restaurant has a tiny staircase that brings you down to the basement, where the service is obviously slower. Those are the good and bad about Sushi Village. Try the Kamikaze Roll if you want a hint of spice!"
Bagel Oasis,"Often regarded as the best bagels in Queens, with an excellent variety of cream cheese spreads and sandwiches available. However, the location is a little far from anything of tourist interest."
The Sandwich Bar,"If you like ""make your own"", this is your place. Choose from seven types of schnitzel (or any of the other entrees or salads); then select sauces and toppings to your taste. Order something different every time; it won't get boring. Kosher."

City Island,Has a good nightlife and is served by the Bx29 from the Pelham Bay Park subway station.
