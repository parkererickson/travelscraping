Buckhorn Exchange,"Denver's oldest restaurant, from 1893, played host to famous guest after famous guest, arguably starting with one President Teddy Roosevelt in 1905. Without a doubt, this is as touristy as it gets, but it is nonetheless absolutely worth a visit. Famous for its game meat, both prosaic and rare, the buffalo tenderloin is exceptional, but more adventurous palates can go after the rattlesnake dip, alligator tail, ostrich medallions, or even yak steak!

Falling Rock Tap House,"The Falling Rock is a beer snob's dream, with over 70 excellent beers on tap. The selection changes from week to week, too, keeping the locals entertained and tipsy off of fine Belgians and microbrews. It gets crowded after Rockies games, but during the off season, it's a great place to escape from the cold and warm up with a well-poured Belgian trippel. For that matter, it's a good place on an average night to ""escape LoDo"" and have a beer in a place where you'll be able to have a good conversation without shouting."
My Brother's Bar,"Brother's is the oldest still-operating bar in Denver, steeped in the history of the Beat movement; Jack Kerouac was a regular here during his years in Denver. Massive selection of premium choices and a fantastic single-malt scotch selection. Classical music plays, but don't expect to hear it on a really busy night. Good food, making this a great casual lunch option, including the JCB: a cheeseburger featuring Jalapeno Cream Cheese. There's no sign on the bar so don't look for one, but it's right on the southeast corner of 15th and Platte streets. This is where the locals go and regulars abound."

The Church,"Part of the ""SoCo"" (South of Colfax) club district, the Church is one of the most popular dance clubs in the city, and as its name suggests, is housed in a former Episcopalian church. That however, does not prevent hundreds if not thousands of people from descending on the dance floor every night to shake what God has given them."

If you are up for a real wild ride, order The Beaver, a huge pitcher of impromptu God-only-knows-what, usually less than $10."
Streets of London Pub,"The closest thing to England you can get without a 10 hour flight, Streets of London has an abundant selection of ales, draughts and other favorites."
Lowry Beer Garden,"New in the Lowry neighborhood, this beer garden is in between two of the old airplane hangars that made up Lowry Air Force Base.
