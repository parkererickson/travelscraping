If you'd like to eat in the gardens, there is a cafe that is open for lunch or you can pick up something from the many takeout places nearby."
City Museum,"For the young or young at heart. Don't let the name fool you; this place is a blast! The City Museum is a huge playground built in an old 11-story warehouse made largely out of architectural artifacts from around St. Louis collected by an eccentric millionaire. There are concessions inside the museum as well as bar service by local brewery Schlafy. While there are plenty of artifacts on display, it's not so much a museum as it is a collection of mazes, obstacle courses, tunnels, airplanes suspended in midair, and chutes and ladders. There's a Ferris wheel on the roof, a ten-story spiral slide, an enormous pipe organ, and lots of ways to get lost. Take care when parking; lots of nearby lots tout the ""City Museum"" on their signs, but only the one on the east side of 16th street (guarded by huge snake sculptures) is officially associated with the museum. Expect to stay here for 3-4 hours."
Contemporary Art Museum,Shares a courtyard with the Pulitzer Foundation for the Arts.
Eads Bridge,"This bridge was the first to cross the Mississippi at St. Louis, the first primarily steel structure in the world, and the longest bridge in the world at completion in 1874. This overlooked landmark is worth checking out for the Eiffel Tower-like steel lattice that still holds up cars and the MetroLink to this day. It connects to Washington Avenue, and is directly adjacent to Laclede's Landing, both are centers of St. Louis nightlife. The easiest way to access Eads Bridge is via the Laclede's Landing MetroLink stop. Well worth a walk across as one of the best places to see the sun setting with the Gateway Arch and city providing a very artistic view of the area."

Equipped with an IMAX Dome theater, a planetarium, floors of interactive activities, and several traveling exhibits, the Science Center has something for everyone (though the majority is geared solidly toward the under-12 set; older teens and adults will find the exhibits somewhat elementary). The museum is actually just south of Forest Park; the planetarium, however, is within the park itself, and an enclosed walkway above I-64 connects the two."

very small,"Designed by Eero Saarinen, this is the world's tallest national monument, built to be a symbolic gateway to the West. The icon of the city, the Arch is right on the bank of the Mississippi and offers an inspiring sight to travelers coming in from Illinois. There's a gift shop and a confectionery, as well as a inspiring film called ""Monument to the Dream,"" about the building of the Arch; it is an exceptionally well-made and memorable tribute to how a vision was made tangible. But the main attraction is the Journey to the Top; you'll ride a unique tram/elevator—essentially a cross between a cable railway and a ferris wheel—up either the north or south leg to the top of the arch, where you can see for dozens of miles into Illinois and Missouri. The cars are very small; they hold five very close friends or relatives each, and are not suitable for the claustrophobic. Tickets sell out during peak season; expect a long wait on major summer holidays to go to the top."
