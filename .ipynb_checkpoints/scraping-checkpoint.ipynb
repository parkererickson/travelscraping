Seating at a single counter, line forms behind stools. Delightfully crunchy hash-browns and greasy egg-dishes will take care of that American diner breakfast craving. Some think it gets by on reputation these days and anywhere with elbow room is better. Only you can decide.</bdi>]], [[<b>Annie's Parlour</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">313 14th Ave SE</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Burgers and malts on the second-story patio.

Vegetarians welcome.</bdi>]], [[<b>Mesa Pizza</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">1323 4th St SE</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Dozens of varieties of pizza, available by the slice or a whole pie.

They offer fresh soft pretzels with sweet'n'hot mustard and an expansive shot list and draft beer selection, helping to make it a local institution. Better than your average college hangout, but if you hate crowds it is best avoided on weekend evenings and game days (especially Gopher's hockey).</bdi>]], [[<b>Obento-Ya</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">1510 Como Ave SE</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Small Japanese bistro.</bdi>]], [[<b>Restaurant Alma</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">528 University Ave SE</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Amazing food which can best be described as a combination between French, Fusion, and small-town Minnesotan.
