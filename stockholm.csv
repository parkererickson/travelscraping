Sergels torg,"Stockholm's busiest city square. The black-and-wine Harlequin concrete floor was laid in the 1960s, and while the design remains controversial, and the place used to have bad reputation for drug-dealing and violence, it attracts thousands of people daily for meet-ups, political demonstrations, flash mobs, and retailing."

The 116-metre steeple is the second tallest in Scandinavia and one of the ten tallest buildings in Sweden, making it a significant landmark. The artwork inside includes an 18th-century altarpiece. In the cemetery, a stone commemorates the 18th-century songwriter Carl Michael Bellman. As of 2013, a building between the church and Vasagatan has been torn down, temporarily making the church visible from the Central Station, until obscured by a newly built hotel."

In the church, there is a monument to the philosopher René Descartes, who spent his last years in Stockholm tutoring Queen Christina, until dying of pneumonia. The church is known for the grave of Prime Minister Olof Palme, who was assassinated in 1986. The grave can be found just to the south of the church building."
Olof Palme assassination scene,"A plaque in the pavement marks Sweden's most infamous crime scene. On February 28, 1986, Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme was walking home from the cinema with his wife, where an unknown man came up behind him, shot him down, and escaped along Tunnelgatan. Though 30 years of investigation, no one has been convicted for the murder. The street nearby was renamed Olof Palmes gata to commemorate the victim."

Clarion Hotel Stockholm,"Ideal location, with lots of restaurants, a walkway along the water, and a laid-back vibe all just outside the hotel's door. Huge hotel with over 500 rooms, but the friendly staff ensure that guests feel welcomed, and there's personalized touches to be had, such as automatic checkout via email and free internet."
