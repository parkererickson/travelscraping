Of the most famous London sights, St Paul's is the one most conveniently located for the Barbican.

The bridge opens several times each day to permit ships to pass through – timings are dependent on demand, and are not regularly scheduled. When Tower Bridge was built, the area to the west of it was a bustling port – necessitating a bridge that could permit tall boats to pass. Now the South Bank area sits to its west, and the regenerated Butler's Wharf area of shops, reasonably-priced riverside restaurants and the London Design Museum lie to its east. For a small charge you can get the lift to the top level of the bridge and admire the view: this includes a visit to a museum dedicated to the bridge's history and engineering, and photographic exhibitions along the Walkways between the towers."

Some areas, such as the St John's Chapel in the White Tower, do not allow photography, but these are clearly signposted. Beefeaters, who are all retired sergeant majors from the British Army, provide guided tours for free as well as ceremonial security.

Some 120,000 bodies are believed to be buried here: as the inscription reads, it is a burial ground for 'nonconformists'. Notably, Bunhill Fields contains the graves of William Blake, Daniel Defoe and John Bunyan. The watchful eye will notice that the paved way across the field is actually made up of tombstones."
Christ Church,"The restoration of the nave was completed in September 2004, and this church is still a striking building designed by Sir Nicholas Hawksmoor with a particularly tall, pointed spire.

Crown Tavern,"A large, traditional pub, rebuilt in 1815 but claiming a history on this site back to 1641. In good weather, outdoor tables in the square can be pleasant. London legend claims that Stalin and Lenin first met in this pub, in a back room (under the ""Conspirators' Clock"") in 1903."
Dirty Dick's,"One of the better known pubs (although definitely no tourist trap) near Liverpool St, supposedly named after a Georgian dandy who let himself go on the death of his fiancée."
Eat & Drink,"A small and fairly ordinary Chinese restaurant by day, this turns into a heaving karaoke bar in the evenings. One of the most reliable places near Liverpool St to get a drink after midnight!"

The Dovetail,Small Belgian bar serving Belgian beer and Belgian food.

Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese,"An old City pub establishment, rebuilt shortly after the Great Fire of 1666. All the monarchs who have reigned in England during the pub's time are written by the main door."
White Hart,"An unpretentious City pub, slightly cheaper than most. Unusually for the area, has a few tables outside where you can watch the world go by in summer or cower under a heat lamp while smoking in winter."
Fox & Anchor,"Independent traditional pub quite close to the Barbican. Beers are often served in pewter tankards for the extra traditional touch. Six rooms are available as well for those who want to sleep where they drink (or just near the Barbican). Great atmosphere but it can be a little more expensive than average, especially the food and lodging."
Jerusalem Tavern,"A converted Georgian coffee shop, which sells the Norfolk beer, St. Peters. The building is from the 1700s, remodelled in 1810, and it was converted in the 1990s, making this both a new and an old pub. The interior is a little small so, while well worth a visit, after 17:00 on weekdays it gets quickly flooded with City workers."
The Jugged Hare,"A gastropub modelled on a traditional countryside drinking establishment, with a hunting theme. The tables are actually old whisky barrels and the decor features several stuffed animals and trophies. Completing the pattern, the food is heavily game-based, with some seafood."
The Old Doctor Butler's Head,"This claims to be one of London's oldest pubs, tracing it history to 1610, although it has been rebuilt since then. The eponymous Doctor Butler was a purveyor of ""medicinal ale"" who was appointed court physician to James I. Pubs selling his beer were allowed to display his portrait, hence the name of the establishment."

Charing Cross Road is famous for its vintage book shops, one stand-out is Foyle's."
Cleopatra's Needle,"Cleopatra's Needle originated in the ancient Egyptian city of Heliopolis, in the Temple of Atum, but the Romans moved it to Alexandria in 12 BC. In 1819, viceroy Mehemet Ali presented Cleopatra's Needle to the British, commemorating military victories in Egypt, but it remained in Alexandria until 1877 when transportation was arranged to bring it to London. On the voyage, the ship capsized in a storm, killing six crewmembers. Cleopatra's Needle was thought to be lost, but Spanish trawlers found it afloat a few days later, and after some repairs, it arrived in London on 21 Jan 1878. The obelisk is flanked by two faux-sphinxes, which show the effects of bombings of London during World War II. Today, Cleopatra's Needle shows some wear from exposure to London's damp weather."
Punch and Judy Tavern,"Once an important working market, and the backdrop for the musical My Fair Lady, Covent Garden today is a covered shopping mall with shops predominantly selling clothing, but also gifts and cosmetics, as well as stalls selling handicrafts (Tues-Sun) or antiques (Mon), and restaurants. It's well worth a visit just for the attractive ambience, with classical musicians busking in the lower part of the market and a famous location for street entertainers. There is a popular pub, The Punch and Judy Tavern at the western end, with a large balcony overlooking a square where street entertainers perform. At the eastern end, the corresponding balcony is occupied by Chez Gerard, a restaurant selling relatively-expensive but good continental cuisine. Most shops are open 10:00-19:00 daily, but may close earlier on Sundays."

Seven Dials,An intersection of seven streets in the northern part of the Covent Garden district. Lots of mid-range designer clothing and shoe stores

Many exhibits charting his life and achievements as well as original artefacts. A special Historical Experience Show runs W-Su at noon, 13:00, 14:00, 15:15, and 16:15 all year round."
London Transport Museum,"In many cities a local transport museum would be of very narrow interest - not London, however! London's public transport is iconic, and the story of how it developed from horse and cart through early buses, Tube trains and trolleybuses to the present day is well worth coming to find out about. There is plenty of opportunity to clamber aboard the historic buses and Tube trains on display. Also, because London's transport is so well known, the museum shop contains plenty of items that make interesting and original gifts and souvenirs."

St Martin's Theatre,The theatre which has been showing The Mousetrap continuously for the past 58 years!
English National Opera,A little easier to get tickets here than it is at the Royal Opera House but still difficult for the most notable productions. Look for last minute availability and off peak performances.
Royal Opera House,"One of the world's great Opera and Ballet venues. Peak time tickets are like gold dust and it is very unlikely that a casual visitor will be able to obtain one. However, at least 65 tickets per performance are held off for on-the-day in person sales from 10AM, and tickets are sometimes available for off peak (especially matinee) performances and can be surprisingly affordable. Check the website or at London ticket agencies."
Ben's Cookies,"Very nice cookies - try their white chocolate with macadamia cookies. Price is about £1 per cookie, and the cookies here are almost twice as big as those at Millie's. They also have branches at 12 Kensington Arcade, Kensington High St; at 39 Leadenhall Market; and at 9 Pelham St, South Kensington."
Monmouth Coffee,"Arguably the best coffee in London. Primarily a venue for quality coffee roasters, the shop on Monmouth street has a tasting room, i.e. a café, where you can marvel at the fact that not everywhere in London sells poor chain-café coffee. A selection of goodies such as croissants, pastries, and brownies are also available. As you would expect of a roasters you can also purchase excellent coffee in bean form or ground, with various blends to suit your taste. Helpful and knowledgeable staff can help you make a selection."
Neal's Yard Dairy,"A fabulous cheese shop specialising in British cheeses. The smell as you walk up the street can be enticing or repulsive, depending on your preference for fragrant cheese. But regardless, a trip to this shop is well worthwhile. Whether they are busy or not, the staff are always keen to have you taste a few cheeses to ensure you find what you are looking for. Everyone here is passionate about their cheese, and while the prices are higher than you will pay pretty much anywhere else in the world for cheese, the quality and taste are second to none."
Stanfords,"This is the flagship store of the world's largest map retailer. They have been selling maps and travel guidebooks of all descriptions from this location since 1901. With three floors of regional maps, walking maps, guidebooks, travel books, a digital mapping service and more this is a huge store that is interesting even if you do not intend to buy anything."
Thomas Neal's,"A nice shopping plaza with clothes shops, design shops and cafes."
The Tintin Shop,"The place to go in Britain for fans of the Belgian reporter. Sells non-fiction books, clothes, posters, figurines and memorabilia, as well as each of Hergé's 24 Adventures of Tintin comicbooks in English, the original French and any other language you can think of."
Angels Fancy Dress,Long established costume hire store. Also has a selection of costumes for retail purchase on the second (US. third) floor.
KRYOLAN CITY LONDON,"This is where the professionals buy make up, so on the pricey side, but the range of products kept is large.  Staff are highly approachable even on specialist queries."
Arthur Beale,A quite unusual shop for the centre of London. A marine supply store which sells numerous items related to yachting: from clothing to sailing hardware and accessories. The shop has been at its current location for over 120 years.
Ocean Leisure,Watersports-related items.
The George,"Established in 1723, not much of the decor has changed in this traditional English pub, where you can order happily inexpensive, tasty food."
Primrose Bakery,"You can get possibly the best cupcakes in London here. They have an impressive clientele that includes U2 and Kate Moss. They also supply Selfridges food hall, Fortnum & Mason and Libertys, where the prices are MUCH higher (£1 more in Fortnum & Mason). They have another branch at 69 Gloucester Ave, Primrose Hill. Try their chocolate on chocolate cupcake with cherry filling."
Brown's,"Always buzzing, this popular restaurant is frequented by hip (often single) clientele, who are served by attentive staff. Meals are good, the braised lamb shank is especially tasty."
Maison Malinowski Brasserie,Serves really delicious crêpes among other things. Perfect for a break while shopping!
Paul's Bakery,"A French favourite, now in London, Paul's serves coffee and teas together fine French pastries, tarts, cakes and breads for savouring on or off the premises. Light snacks, lunches and dinners are also catered for, at prices a little higher than your average café (but reasonable for the touristy Covent Garden), somewhat less than a restaurant."
Cafe Pacifico,"London's original Mexican Cantina, serving all your typical Mexican food along with a good range of margaritas and tequila."
La Perla,"Another of Cafe Pacifico's venues, this one is slightly smaller with more of a bar feeling."
Scoop,"This place is popular among the university students in London. Come here for some genuine Italian gelato or coffee and cake. Try their hazelnut gelato, which is simply amazing."
The Ivy,"Wining and dining rooms of celebrities, the actual difficulty in getting a table these days gives the restaurant slightly more kudos as an eatery than it deserves. Cosy and intimate, serving traditional but diverse restaurant meals. Competent cooking and reasonably good service, but not worth waiting 6 months for. Unless you are an avid star-gazer, go at a time when celebs are unlikely to be around."
Joe Allen,"Legendary informal bistro which is incredibly hard to find for the first time - look for the dark, discrete door with a simple plaque on it on the north side of Exeter St. Food is a take on American style grilled fare using the very highest quality ingredients. Steaks and chops are superb. Favoured by lots of celebs and booking essential, especially pre- and post theatre."
Rules,"Claims to the oldest restaurant still-going in London. It's high-class decor matches its posh diners. Rules has a dress code: ""jacket or tie not required, but smart casual preferred. No shorts."""
Princess Louise,"Ornately designed Victorian interior, mostly preserved from an 1891 remodelling, with wood and etched-glass partitions dividing it into smaller sections. A Grade II listed building and on CAMRA's national inventory of historic pub interiors."
The Salisbury,"Beautifully preserved Victorian pub. Full of mirrors and lights, cut glass and mahogany, this place is nothing like the dark and dingy pubs that are all too common in London."
Ernest Sports bar,A modern sports bar to watch champions league and premiership action.Serving local ales and international beers. Beers from £5.
The Intrepid Fox,The best rock and metal pub in London.
Porterhouse,"A modern pub split across multiple levels connected by narrow staircases and walkways, with a selection of over 100 bottled beers from around the world."
Waxy's Little Sister,"Irish themed pub with a fibreglass tree inside it. It is almost invariably unbearably crowded. The smaller Waxy's Little Sister opposite it, however, is generally quieter and more relaxed."
The Spice of Life,"On Cambridge Circus, is a bustling middle-of-the-road gaf, with open-mic performances from talented musicians downstairs."
Rum Bar,"Asia de Cuba, the trendy restaurant located inside the St. Martin's Lane Hotel, also houses the stylish Rum Bar. With tall, 'lean-on' tables designed by Phillipe Starck and a meticulously designed interior this is a great place to meet for a cocktails before or after heading out for an evening."
Light,"Stylish, ultra modern space inside the St. Martin’s Lane Hotel. On Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights, many of London's most popular D.J.'s are featured."
Freud,"If you blink, you'll miss this casual cellar bar that serves up a variety of cocktails you can't find anywhere else in London. Has good mojitos, and even an Apple Pie concoction that tastes like a drink version of the real thing! Always very crowded at night on the weekends despite the fact that you need to go down a rickety metal staircase to find it."
Guanabara,"A vibrant Brazilian bar, next to the New London Theatre, which attracts a large Latin dancing crowd. Different types of music, with good DJ's and bands, are played each night of the week, such as flamenco, forró, lambada and even American country."
Box,A trendy gay bar.
Halfway to Heaven,"Traditional pub owned by the night club, Heaven. Aimed more at office workers and locals than the clubbing crowd. The basement bar hosts entertainment in the evenings."
Heaven,"Arguably the most famous gay club in London, and perhaps the world. Has secret performances by the likes of Britney Spears or Kylie Minogue. Good fun, whether gay or straight."
The Retro Bar,The antidote to gay bars: a pub-like atmosphere and great music.
Fielding Hotel,No frills hotel located right opposite the Royal Opera House.
Strand Palace Hotel,Good value hotel in a convenient location for Covent Garden theatres and shopping
Travelodge London Covent Garden,Popular hotel with visitors and decent value for the area. Convenient for Covent Garden theatres and shopping.
The Savoy,"The famed Savoy is on The Strand in the heart of the West End theatre district, offering magnificent views of the river Thames. The Savoy opened in 1889 and remains a popular destination in London. The hotel has 263 rooms and suites, a nifty blend of elegance and contemporary design. Inventive cuisine can be enjoyed in the Savoy Grill and the more informal Banquette. The theatres, opera, ballet and shopping of Covent Garden are located nearby."
St Martins Lane,"Ian Schrager (he of Studio 54 fame) is known worldwide for being an innovator in the ‘hip’ hotel business. His first foray into London, St Martins Lane, is a playful and urbane destination in the West End theater district off Trafalgar Square that combines urban cool and modern design (via design guru Philippe Starck). Unique features to this trendy-meets-luxury hotel include Asia de Cuba restaurant, the popular Light Bar and interactive light displays in every guest room that encourage guests to personalize their own individual space."
Bunhill Fields Burial Ground,"First used to bury bones to make space at St Paul's, it was designated as a burial ground during the Great Plague of 1665. Notable interments include Daniel Dafoe, John Bunyan and William Blake."
The Honourable Society of Gray's Inn,"One of the four Inns of Court in London who hold the exclusive right to call qualified legal professionals to the bar, i.e. to become barristers at law. The grand buildings housing the inns are arranged around lovely green gardens. There are records of Gray's Inns operating from this location since the 14th century."
The Honorable Society of Lincoln's Inn,"Like Gray's Inn, one the of the four societies of the bar. The wonderful old buildings here are arranged around the open spaces of Lincoln's Inn Fields and a walk around this area will give any visitor a real sense of the history and grand traditions of the legal profession in London."
Myddelton Square Park,Nice shady park next to St Marks Church. Small children's playground.
Royal Courts of Justice,"The building holds the High Court and the Court of Appeal, two of the highest courts in the United Kingdom, though only civil cases are heard here. Trials are open to the public, but tourists would probably be more interested in seeing the impressive entrance hall, and admiring the stunning Victorian Gothic exterior."
Staple Inn,"See the rare range of Tudor half-timbered buildings. Staple Inn was built in 1585 and served as an inn Inn of Chancery (law school). Most of it escaped both the Great Fire and the German air raids, unlike other buildings in the area. The western end is actually from a different, adjoining building—which was incorporated into the Inn with a unified facade during restoration work in 1936, although the difference can still be seen in the roofing and slightly different style. One of Charles Dickens's homes was on the site and it was featured in his Mystery of Edwin Drood."
Temple Church,Has a history dating back to the 12th century with connections to the order of Templars. The chancel of the church was build by Henry III. The church still serves the members of Gray's Inn and Lincoln's Inn and has frequent service open to the public.

Two Temple Place,"A former home for William Waldorf Astor, a wealthy American moved to London at the end of 19th century. This Victorian house, built between 1892-1895 by John Loughborough Pearson. is in an eclectic Neo-Gothic style. It's richly decorated from outside, but even more rich and heavily eclectic inside.

A café, a shop and a cloakroom are open for visitors during these days."

There is a display of some of Soane's architectural plans on the upper floor. Be sure to wait in the picture room until the guides open the walls up to reveal further paintings behind. The museum is a little-known tourist attraction, but well worth a visit. Admission free (but you're encouraged to leave a donation)."
Courtauld Institute,"Somerset House is home to three art galleries: The exceptional Courtauld Institute displays a collection of 19th- and 20th-century art, including well-known works by Degas, Matisse and Kandinsky; The Gilbert Collection presents a collection of decorative art; and the Hermitage Rooms, the most recent addition to Somerset House, hosts temporary exhibitions of works on loan from the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg. The central courtyard is filled with fountains in the Summer, but in the Winter, an ice rink is installed, it is very popular, so visitors should book in advance, or expect to wait a long time to skate."

Gresham College,"Attend free public lectures, in Barnard's Inn Hall (mostly, but other venues are used as well), renowned historic Inn of Court featured in Charles Dickens' Great Expectations."

Peacock Theatre,"Owned by LSE, and actually part of their campus, this theatre is currently leased to Sadler's Wells as ""Sadler's Wells in the West End""."
Sadler's Wells Theatre,"Leading dance production theatre with an amazing history back to the 1690s.  Everything from classical ballet to hip hop. For ballet fans, you have often got a much better chance of securing a ticket here than in the Covent Garden venues.  Also attached is the Lilian Baylis Theatre, primarily performances by students."
Somerset House Ice Rink,"In the courtyard of Somerset House, this has become a Londoner's favorite, although how it will compete with the newcomers remains to be seen. It is preferable to visit at night, when the Christmas tree is lit up."

Magma Books,"A fine bookshop specialising in the graphic arts, as well as toys, for not-quite-grown-up boys. A good place to pick up foreign design titles, or simply waste an hour browsing through lots of pretty books. A valuable stop for graphic junkies."
The Old Curiosity Shop,"The original shop immortalised in the Charles Dickens' novel by the same name. Nestled amongst the campus of LSE, it is worth a visit just for the old Tudor design itself. As the name suggests, it sells some oddities and knick-knacks, but mostly shoes these days."

Betsey Trotwood,"Live music in the cellar every Friday. Venue is like a very small dungeon, but they know what is good music."
The Craft Beer Company,"One of RateBeer's Top 50 bars in the world, and only one of two in the UK (see CASK Pub & Kitchen in Pimlico for the other). Famous for its vast selection beers: cask, keg and bottle."
Crown Tavern,"A large, traditional pub, rebuilt in 1815 but claiming a history on this site back to 1641. In good weather, outdoor tables in the square can be pleasant. London legend claims that Stalin and Lenin first met in this pub, in a back room (under the ""Conspirators' Clock"") in 1903."
The Dovetail,Small Belgian bar serving Belgian beer and Belgian food.
Fluid,"A stylish loosely Japanese themed bar upstairs (they serve sushi), with a more spread out dance floor down a spiral metal staircase. Plenty of sofas everywhere, although on the weekends you will have to get down early to slump in a chair."
Fox & Anchor,"Independent traditional pub quite close to the Barbican. Beers are often served in pewter tankards for the extra traditional touch. Six rooms are available for those who want to sleep where they drink (or just near the Barbican). Great atmosphere but it can be a little more expensive than average, especially the food and lodging."
Horseshoe,"Irish pub where they play live Irish music every Thursday at 8PM (check it on the net!). But, be there in due time, else you risk house full!"
Jerusalem Tavern,"A converted Georgian coffee shop, which sells the Norfolk beer, St. Peters. Well worth a visit but after 5PM on weekdays, it gets flooded with City workers."
Cafe Kick,"Hidden down a backstreet away from the busier parts of Clerkenwell, lies a cosy little bar crammed with several table football machines, and a good selection of cocktails. In the summer people spread out onto the pedestrianised street and chat in the sun. Happy hour 4-7PM daily."
Water Rats Pub,Has regular live bands.
Cittie of Yorke,"The interior gives the impression of being a historic relic but it was only built in 1924 (although there have been other pubs on the site since 1430). Lack of authenticity aside, it really is an impressive and atmospheric pub, a grade II listed building and on CAMRA's national inventory of historic pub interiors."
The Knights Templar,Part of the JD Wetherspoon chain. The building is the former Union Bank and it has nice high-vaulted ceilings with black pillars. The drinks range includes a range of often changing guests beers.
The Penderel's Oak,"Part of the JD Wetherspoon chain. The open-plan, L-shaped ground floor bar is known for a varied selection of guest beers (but poor Wi-Fi). The basement bar is actually part of the Lloyds No. 1 chain, with background music and a different atmosphere."
The Shakespeare's Head,Part of the JD Wetherspoon chain.
The Square Pig,"Can be pricey and crowded too, but that's because it's used for large language-exchange and online meet-ups."
Ye Olde Mitre,"Called the hardest to find pub in London. A small but historic and award-winning pub; it dates to 1586 and marked the boundary between the gardens of Christopher Hatton and the Bishop of Ely. Parts of the Tudor pub remain, although it was rebuilt in 1757 and partially altered in 1781 and 1930; now a Grade II listed building. It's tied to Fuller's brewery, so it has their usual range plus a few unusual guests. Only open one weekend in the year, to coincide with CAMRA's Great British Beer Festival in August."
Ye Old White Horse,"Great little Victorian pub adjacent to the LSE campus. The Horse is one of the last remaining little boozers of its kind; a true throwback. Warm, welcoming, well-preserved interior, well-kept real ales, and a low-priced selection of sandwiches and pub meals make this place worth a visit while passing through Holborn."
Old Fountain,"Local CAMRA Pub of the Year 2011. This traditional pub is known for its large beer selection, mostly from local and micro-breweries."
Fabric,"A massive club (think cathedral scale) that provides a more underground version of Ministry of Sound and hosts some of the biggest names in dance music, from Goldie to David Holmes to the Scratch Perverts. There are always big queues, so get down early if you can."
The Nightjar,Speakeasy-style cocktail bar. Regular live music fitting the prohibition era theme.
Sosho,"Sosho is a former photographic studio and warehouse space converted into a two floor restaurant, bar, lounge and club with a 24 hour licence, midway between the city and central Shoreditch. Sosho is light and airy during the day time, candle lit and loungey in the evening. Serve carefully sourced and proper food, with world class cocktails and great music on one of East London's best sound system. With a 24 hour licence it is a late night drinking and DJ bar during the week and a cutting edge clubbing venue at the weekend."

Swinton Hotel,Good value bed and breakfast in the north west of the district.

MiNC Eagle Court,"Studio, one and two bedroom service apartments. Very modern and nicely appointed."
Malmaison London,"Studio, one and two bedroom service apartments. Very modern and nicely appointed."
Rosewood Chancery Court London,"Try this hotel for a very upscale experience.  It is in an older building that has been beautifully renovated (formerly HQ of Pearl Assurance).  There is high-speed internet, but the charge is £15 per day.  The hotel is air-conditioned.  The staff is very helpful.  A great experience, if you can pay the rates."
The Rookery,An atmosphere and decor that more recalls a private gentleman's club than a hotel.
Trafalgar Square,"The main, central square of London, Trafalgar Square is associated with celebration and demonstration - it is the site of London's lacklustre New Year celebrations, and in 2003 was the site of the triumphant homecoming of the British Rugby team from the World Cup, and a centre for demonstration against Britain's involvement in the Iraq War. In recent years, the square has been associated with the many hundreds of pigeons that used to be found here, but London's Mayor Ken Livingstone passed a bylaw in 2003 making it illegal to feed them. Nelson's Column, surrounded by the four bronze lions can be found here, on the south side of the square. The north-west plinth in the square has been vacant since 1841, and controversial contemporary sculpture has been displayed here in recent years."
National Gallery,"Houses the British national collection of western European art dating from the 13th to 19th centuries. A truly awe-inspiring collection, notable works include Hans Holbein's The Ambassadors, Van Gogh's Sunflowers and Constable's The Haywain. The vast majority of art is free of charge to visit. Temporary exhibitions are generally fairly costly, but invariably well researched and presented.  The audioguides are very comprehensive, have comments on most of the paintings in the museum, and are free though this fact is not advertised. A donation is suggested. In addition to courses, workshops, lectures and other events, the National Gallery has free talks and tours every day."
National Portrait Gallery,"The National Portrait Gallery is just around the corner from the National Gallery and is an entertaining way to learn about British history since the Tudors. Visitors walk around the gallery chronologically, viewing portraits of notable figures from British history - from Henry VII, painted by Hans Holbein, to Blur, painted by Julian Opie."
St Martins in the Fields,"A classical church that stands opposite the National Gallery. Since WWI, the homeless have sought shelter at this church, a tradition that continues to this day."

Chinese arches,The three ornamental Chinese arches are worth a look.
Chinatown phone booths,"Chinatown does incorporate some entertaining combinations of British and Chinese culture, such as the phone booths with pagoda-style sloping roofs."

Vue Cinemas,Also includes the Odeon Mezzanine and Odeon West End
Curzon Soho Cinema,"Voted ""London's Number 1 Cinema"" by Time Out readers, great bar and a fantastic art-house program."

They do not screen the latest films but usually have an interesting selection, including foreign and art house films and often have theme nights. Get hold of the program at the door or on the internet and consider buying the discount-granting yearly membership if you plan to come back a few times."

In recent years, the festival has expanded south into Leicester Sq and Trafalgar Sq to try to alleviate the congestion."
M&M's World,"The largest sweet shop in the world. Unlike the New York City store you can only buy the ""regular"" M&M flavours here, albeit in a wider variety of colours than you would usually find. There is also a wide array of other merchandise available such as homeware and clothing."
THE LEGO STORE,"Opened in November 2016, this is officially the world's largest LEGO Store. Also has a massive Big Ben (yes, they mean the clock tower and not the actual bell. Feel free to tut loudly) sculpture made of said building blocks."

China China,"At the budget end of the scale, China China at the eastern end of the north side of Gerrard Street offers Hong Kong diner style meals of cold meat on hot rice."
Friendly Inn,"Offers cheap fare on the southern side of Gerrard Street. The restaurant lives up to its name with very enthusiastic serving staff, but unless you stick to the set menus, the cost of the meal can soon increase."
Luxuriance Peking Cuisine,"This family-owned business that started up in 1980 is famous for its freshly cooked crispy aromatic duck, seafood banquet and pork spare ribs. The interior is comfortable, relaxed and modern."
Mr Kong,Reputed to have the best vegetarian food in Chinatown.
New World,"A well-decorated and plush-looking restaurant which serves excellent dim sum on trolleys from midday until around 6PM. Good quality evening food is available thereafter, and the service is very good overall."
Wong Kei,"A Chinatown institution. Popular with Londoners and visitors alike and possibly the best value Chinese restaurant in the whole of London. Spread across four floors, this restaurant is infamous for its surly, abrupt service and this has become part of the experience of dining there. Depending on how drunk you look, the higher up the building you will be sent. Tea is complimentary, though somewhat bland. Set meals present excellent value for money, some being under £5. The sweet and sour pork is remarkably good."
1997,Cosy place to visit if you are not feeling in an alcoholic mood. They provide a good selection of iced and pearl tapioca teas which are often hard to come by outside of Hong Kong.
Cork and Bottle Wine Bar,"More of a wine bar than a restaurant, the extensive wine list featuring selections from Australia and California. They offer reasonable cuisine to wash down this full bodied wines."
De Hems,"Dutch-themed pub with an excellent selection of beers. It is often crowded, but has a good atmosphere and a comedy club."
Trash Palace,"Fantastic small gay bar, mixed music and a laid back mixed crowd."

Bubbleology,Quirky shop selling bubble teas in a very interesting way.
Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel,"Small luxury hotel furnished in a sleek, contemporary design."
Thistle Piccadilly,Affordable and centrally located but a tired property.
The Trafalgar,Hilton's first boutique hotel in London.
Premier Inn London Leicester Square,"Premier Inn are a popular mid-range budget hotel chain, but in this location you're unlikely to find a night for under £100."
Marble Arch,"This enormous arch was originally situated in front of Buckingham Palace. In 1851 the expansion of the palace meant the arch could no longer remain where it was, so it was moved to this point on Hyde Park. It now stands rather sadly on a large traffic island, but the subway beneath the roads mean you can stop off at the Marble Arch on your way from Oxford St to Hyde Park."
Regent's Park,"Large open space very popular with Londoners and less visited by tourists than the other great city parks. A number of lovely lakes, an open air theatre, regular puppet shows, various sporting activities and some splendid ancient trees. There is also a cafe and play area next to the boating pond."

Wellington Arch,"A grand neoclassical arch, designed by Decimus Burton and first erected in 1826 as a grand entrance to Buckingham Palace. From 1846 onwards, the arch was topped with a massive equestrian statue of the Duke of Wellington - a major road widening of Piccadilly in 1882 was the opportunity to finally remove the over sized statue to Aldershot. The present magnificent statue Peace Descending on the Quadriga of War was placed on top of the Arch in 1912, and remains today the largest bronze sculpture in the United Kingdom, spectacularly lit at night. During the 1950s, the arch served as the smallest police station in the city, when it was occupied by ten constables, two sergeants and a cat! The arch was opened to the public for the first time in April 2001 after a £1.5 million restoration by English Heritage. (Wellington Arch is also available for corporate and private events - with dramatic views down Constitution Hill and across central London from the Arch's spacious balconies, Wellington Arch is a novel and unique place to impress your guests)."

Apsley House,"The former home of the 1st Duke of Wellington, boasting an impressive collection of paintings, sculpture, medals and swords."
Handel & Hendrix in London,"Home to the baroque composer George Frideric Handel from 1723 until his death in 1759. Some of the greatest classical music ever composed was done so at this address. The museum charts Handel's life and works and offers recitals of music in the magnificent setting of the period rooms. By contrast, next door was home to Jimi Hendrix when he lived in London in 1969, and entry to this top floor flat is included."
Madame Tussauds,"Madame Tussaud's is a world famous waxwork museum, best known for its Grand Hall, with a collection of international royalty, statesmen and world leaders. Visitors generally report that the entrance fee does not warrant the selection of waxworks on show, which rarely resemble the celebrities. Also, there is usually a long queue stretching down the road."
The Royal Academy of Arts,"The Royal Academy no longer has a permanent exhibition space, instead hosting art exhibitions. Notable recent exhibitions have included the paintings of Monet, contemporary art associated with the theme of apocalypse, and Aztec art. Each Summer, the Royal Academy plays host to a Summer Exhibition, displaying 1,200 new works by established and new artists selected by the academy, most of which are available for visitors to buy. Each member has to donate a work of art, so over the years, the academy has built a sizable collection. Exhibitions are invariably excellent, and it is worth paying for audio guides, if they are not included. Visitors should book tickets in advance, as exhibitions are often very popular - particularly shortly after opening."
Sherlock Holmes Museum,Discover mementos of this famous fictional detective.
Wallace Collection,"The Wallace Collection is one of the world's finest private art collections, the best known of which is Frans Hals's work The Laughing Cavalier. Other artists on display include Rembrandt, Titian, Poussin, and Reynolds. Well worth escaping to after the hustle and bustle of Oxford Street."

Paul,French patisserie and bakery with some seating available.
Sea Shell of Lisson Grove,A premium fish and chip shop that has some seating as well as dishing up hundreds of take-away packages every day. Londoners travel miles to order here. The effort is well and truly worth it.

Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,Five star hotel with 444 rooms and suites. The hotel is host to Locanda Locatelli Michelin star Italian restaurant.
London Marriott Hotel Marble Arch,"Less expensive than some of the other hotels in the area. It is on a side street, so it is a little quieter.

The Ritz Hotel London,"One of the London's great hotels for more than a century. Located on Piccadilly over-looking Green Park. If you cannot afford to stay here (likely), then a splurge on afternoon tea is recommended. Dress appropriately though otherwise you will not get past the door."
Holland Park,"Holland Park is a mixture of open spaces, woodland and formal gardens. It includes a large field dedicated to football and cricket, as well as tennis courts. It was originally the private garden of Holland House, much of which was destroyed. As you walk around the park, you can see bits of the building dotted around the place which give you some idea of how grand it used to be. In the summer this is a great place to catch outdoor opera. An ecology centre located near the police station provides information about the ecology of the park and arranges various activities for children. A cafe is located nearby that sells ice creams and hot food. The park is an ideal way to walk from Notting Hill Gate to Kensington High St."
Design Museum,"A must for anyone with an interest in modern and contemporary design. The permanent exhibition follows the change in British homes from the early 20th century until present day, which is constantly updated to include new design classics. There are temporary exhibits which run for 3-4 months. Recent exhibits have included Saul Bass, Peter Saville and Archigram. The museum also runs Designer of the Year which awards a prize to a person or organisation that has produced an impressive piece of design (past winner was Jonathan Ive, who designed the iMac and iPod). There is a small shop that has plenty of art and design books as well as designer goods to take home with you."
Leighton House,"The former Victorian home of an artist Frederic (Lord) Leighton. While regarded as one of the finest examples of Victorian residential architecture, it's not a usual Neo-Gothic venue. The entrance rooms, esp. so-called the Arabic Hall, look like an eclectic cross-breed between the Alhambra and Topkapi Palace. It may sound quite terrible, but surprisingly it works quite convincing. While the rest of the building is less vividly decorated it's still designed rather good and the admirers of Pre-Raphaelite art would find there some works by Lord Leighton (PRA) himself, his fellow Pre-Raphaelites, but also a handful of works by Delacroix, Corot as well as a collection of some colourful pottery. Regular small exhibitions are hold at the extension of the house. Unfortunately the museum is unwilling to give away their photos for free, so try to turn on your imagination to see how it may look like."

The Electric shows a wide range of films from cinema classics, cult and independent films, to regular Hollywood blockbusters. They also have the Electric Scream session, specifically for parents with screaming babies! Ticket prices vary depending on how fancy your seat is. More expensive than a normal cinema but a fun experience."

Gate Picturehouse,Repetorty/arthouse cinema with a very varied programme.

Notting Hill Carnival,"Two day carnival which takes place every year on the August Bank Holiday weekend. It is said to be the largest carnival of its type in the world, attracts over a million people and is a great celebration of London's modern multi-cultural identity. What really gives it flavour is the large local Caribbean and Trinidadian population. This occurs in an almost circular route north of the Notting Hill, Westbourne Park and Ladbroke Grove areas. If intending to visit, see Transport For London's website in advance as many tube stations are closed for the duration and bus routes diverted. Driving into the area is highly discouraged - many streets are closed."

Kahn's,"Very popular and large Indian restaurant, probably not as good as the Standard though."

Uses it early morning market licence to open with the dawn on weekdays. No bar food served on Saturdays but the restaurant upstairs is still open (M–Th noon–15:00; F–Su noon–17:00)."

Park Plaza County Hall,Stylish and reputable.
Victoria and Albert Museum,"Named in honour of Queen Victoria and her consort Prince Albert, this museum has existed for over 150 years. It contains a huge collection of decorative arts from all over the world and far back in time, trying to see everything in one day would be exhausting. There are regular exhibitions concentrating on a particular theme from Chinese art to fashion designers. Frequently they put on children's activities and late DJ nights."
Natural History Museum,"Probably the most popular of all the museums here and a must see for many visitors to London. Home to no less than 70 million specimens from across all the life sciences. It's difficult to say what the most popular exhibit here is; the diplodocus which towers over the entrance hall, the (now slightly tacky-looking) animatronic tyrannasaurs in the dinosaur gallery, or the life-size model blue whale in the mammals gallery. Also well worth a check are the recently-opened Darwin Centre (book on a free tour to see some of the most interesting, and sometimes gruesome, specimens not on public display); and the studio dedicated to BBC wildlife personality extraordinaire, David Attenborough. The NHM's ""Earth Galleries"" were once the adjacent Geological Museum, an independent institution until the 1980s, and still located in a separate building with a separate entrance."
Science Museum,"Dedicated to scientific exhibitions and collections bar those related to the life sciences. A number of famous historical machines and inventions are housed here including Stephenson's Rocket. The space exhibits are especially popular. Exhibitions tend to concentrate on explaining scientific principles with working models and there is a strong emphasis on education and attracting children. The Science Museum first opened a ""Children's Gallery"" in the 1930s and it continues to lead the way in this area; now, there are three separate galleries aimed at all ages of younger visitor, from 5 to 16. The museum also runs ""Science Nights"" whereby children spend an evening learning principles and participating in experiments before spending the night sleeping in the museum with the exhibits. Also houses a vast library of scientific and medical books and journals."
The Geological Museum,"This venerable old institution was absorbed by the neighbouring Natural History Museum in 1985 but still has something of a separate identity. Unsurprisingly, devoted to all things geological with especially popular exhibits on vulcanology and earthquakes and fossils of all types. Very popular with kids and often under-rated."
National Army Museum,Re-opened on 30 March 2017.
Chelsea Physic Garden,"Garden founded by apothecaries in the 17th century to the medicinal properties of plants. It was only opened to the public in the 1980's when it became a charity. The heat-sink caused by its thick walls, combined with the general waste heat of London itself, keeps the garden much warmer than it would otherwise be at this latitude. Due to this, the garden contains the world's most northerly example of a grapefruit outside of a greenhouse, and the largest fruiting olive tree in the country. The collection contains thousands of different plant species."
Hyde Park,"The eastern half of the twin parks. Of the two Hyde Park is open for longer and has more open, unwooded land; it is often host to concerts, fun fairs and events."

Rose Garden,"The eastern half of the twin parks. Of the two Hyde Park is open for longer and has more open, unwooded land; it is often host to concerts, fun fairs and events."
The Long Water,"The Serpentine is a small, artificial lake within Hyde Park which contains a range of waterfowl and fish. It was first made by damming the River Westbourne but it is now fed by three boreholes. The western end of the lake is actually in Kensington Gardens, in which it is called The Long Water."
Speakers Corner,"By custom, in this far northeastern corner of the park (by the Marble Arch Tube stop near Mayfair), people are free to say whatever they like about who and whatever they like. Worth checking out to see the lunatics and exhibitionists spouting off."
Kensington Gardens,"The western half of the twin parks and the half that is often forgotten in public consciousness. It tends to be more formal than its neighbouring park and it closes at dusk, while Hyde Park is open until midnight."
Royal Albert Hall,"Highly detailed, Gothic-style monument to commemorate Price Albert, husband of Queen Victoria. Opposite the Royal Albert Hall."
Diana Memorial Playground,"Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Playground"

Italian Gardens,A 900-year-old tree stump carved and painted to feature elves and small animals.
Kensington Palace,A royal residence which is still used by some members of the ruling family. Much of it is however open to the public and it is a very popular tourist attraction perhaps due as much to its association with Princess Diana as anything else. The King's Gallery here is a magnificent Regency period court drawing room and contains some impressive paintings including a Van Dyke. Also a nice restaurant on site called The Orangery.
The Round Pond,A pond that is round. Deckchairs can be hired for £1.50. The park benches and grassy areas are free.
The Serpentine Gallery,"A nice free art gallery, near to the Serpentine. Each summer a pavilion next to the gallery is designed by a different architect, which then houses various cultural events."
Kensington Roof Gardens,"High above High Street Kensington is an unlikely place to find ornamental gardens. Nevertheless, three themed gardens can be found here: a Spanish Garden, a Tudor Garden and an English Woodland, covering 1.5 acres of rooftop. They were created in the 1930s by the owners of what was then the department store underneath. You can gaze at a stream and its resident flamingos while looking over the rooftops of Kensington. A restaurant and nightclub can also be found up here."
Roper's Garden,"Small green area, with benches, by the Thames. Created in the crater of a World War II bomb site, it contains an ancient cherry tree to commemorate the visit of Gunji Koizumi, the man who introduced judo to the country. Named after Margaret Roper née More, to whom the area was a gift from her father, Sir Thomas More, on her marriage to William Roper."

Sir William Gilbert's House,One half of the comic opera writing team Gilbert & Sullivan lived here.
Sir Winston Churchill's House,One of the UK's greatest prime ministers lived and died at this address.
Billionaries' Row,"One of the most expensive residential streets on the planet! Most of the buildings here are embassies or ambassadorial residences but the rest of the mansions belong to some of the richest people in the country (or elsewhere). For added historical value, during World War II, the current Norwegian embassy was where King Haakon VII led the Norwegian government-in-exile (commemorated by a blue plaque) and MI19's ""London Cage"" prisoner-of-war facility was located here. There is no public right of way but the Crown Estate allow pedestrians and cyclists to use the street; photography is not permitted."

Carlyle's House,"Now preserved by the National Trust, this 18th century house was the home of the historian Thomas Carlyle from 1834 and now houses a museum dedicated to his life and work."
Chelsea Old Church,This church on the bank of the Thames was built in 1157. It is the only church in London with chained books. A statue of Thomas More sits in front of the church.
Crosby Hall,"All that remains of a Tudor mansion originally located in the City of London. In 1910, to avoid demolition to make way for a bank, is was moved brick by brick and reassembled at Cheyne Walk. It is now a Grade II* listed building and possibly the largest private home in the capital."
Holy Trinity Church,"From their website: ""In common with the aims of the Arts & Crafts Movement, the architect of Holy Trinity Church, John Dando Sedding, believed that a church should be 'wrought and painted over with everything that has life and beauty—in frank and fearless naturalism.'"" Naturalism or not, the church is known as an ornate building."
Royal Hospital,A retirement home for soldiers created by King Charles II. Tours around the listed building and grounds are regular and include the museum (which can be visited separately) whose exhibits contain military memorabilia donated by Chelsea Pensioners over the years.
Brompton Cemetery,"One of the ""Magnificent Seven"" old cemeteries in London.  Graves range from plain to ornate and the site can be a tranquil place to walk amid the bustle of the city.  It was opened in 1840 and is still a working cemetery, although it was closed for a some time in the late twentieth century.  Can be nice, if morbid, for an afternoon stroll, especially as a route (and cycle route) between Old Brompton Road and Fulham Road."
Penfold Post Box,"One of the few Victorian hexagonal Penfold post boxes still in use.  Although there are others in this district, this one in notable for a narrow escape during WW2: minor bomb damage can still be seen in the base of the pillar."
Police Box,This police box was intended as part of a 1990s high-tech revival of the 1920s-60s police box system.  The experiment failed and this is now the only police box left in London.  It remains as street furniture and is quite popular with fans of the TV series Doctor Who.
Royal College of Art,"A Victorian school, an currently active University, with a mission to advance knowledge of the fine arts.  Exhibitions are common.  Times and admission charges vary but can often be free, although visitors may need to book tickets to certain events."
Royal College of Music,"Victorian school of music created on a suggestion by Prince Albert.  It is still an active school but visitors may be more interested in its museum and performances.  The free museum houses instruments dating back to the 15th century with several unusual pieces.  Performances—by students, professors or visitors—are often free as well."
Saatchi Gallery,"Prestigious contemporary art gallery worth a visit. From 5 Apr to 4 Sep 2016 it has a large exhibition on the Rolling Stones, for which there are timed tickets and an admission charge."
London Cru,"Urban winery based in West London run by a team of experts that include international winemaker Gavin Monery and Master of Wine student Mark Andrew. The winery offers public tours, wine tastings, courses, and custom winemaking."
Boating on the Serpentine,Rowing boats and pedalos are available for hire from Easter until the end of October.
Earl's Court Exhibition Centre,"Hosts frequent conventions, exhibitions, concerts and events. Located on the site used for Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show in the 19th century. It has two halls, Earl's Court One and Earl's Court Two. See it while you can; the site has controversially been scheduled to be demolished and redeveloped. Times and prices vary."
Hyde Park Tennis and Sports Centre,"Contains six hard tennis courts, two mini tennis courts, a six-rink lawn bowling green and a nine-hole putting green; plus support facilities such as changing rooms and a café.

Olympia London,"Another exhibition centre, owned by the same company as Earl's Court Exhibition Centre. It hosts the same range of conventions, fairs and events. Olympia has four halls and a conference centre, with a mix of trade shows and public events, so there is almost always something to see. Times and prices vary."
BBC Proms,"Since opening in 1871 as part of Queen Victoria's memorial to her late husband it has become one of the most famous venues in the UK, and remains one of London's main concert halls. It still mainly caters for a classical audience, but it also hosts many other varied events including the odd contemporary rock/pop acts, and its corridors are sometimes used as exhibition spaces. During July–September the Albert Hall hosts the BBC Proms. This British national institution is a series of nightly classical concerts with world-leading performers for which standing tickets can be bought on the door on the night for as little as £5."
Royal Court Theatre,Britain's leading national theatre company dedicated to new work by innovative writers from the UK and around the world.
The Troubadour,"Famous bohemian cafe with a pleasing menu of hearty dishes such as fishcakes, burgers and delicious filling salads. Good wine list too and lovely leafy garden out the back. There is a great little music venue downstairs and even accommodation on the top floor. As a music venue, the Troubadour has been programming acoustic music since the 1950s when Bob Dylan et al took to the stage. It's bigger now and has gone electric but is still one of the best venues in London for up and coming talent. The musical spectrum is broad. On any night you might catch solo singer-songwriters or full bands. No heavy rock or covers bands though. More recently it has hosted Adele, Laura Marlin, Jamie T and The Kleeks. There is a good menu too but arrive early to get a table. It can get very busy. Well worth a visit."
The Duke of York Square Shopping Complex,"Has a range of spacious branches of popular fashion chains, but lacks some of the road's character, however the small adjoining public space of Duke of York square is a welcome place for a rest between shopping, and a popular place to hang out."
Harrods,"The most famous store in London, favoured by the British establishment and owned by Mohamed Al-Fayed. Fairly strict dress code so do not turn up looking like a backpacker and expect to gain entrance."
Harvey Nichols,Large department store full of designer goods and an excellent cafe.
The Hummingbird Bakery,A nice little bakery with wonderful cupcakes. Try their red velvet cupcake that is incredibly popular with the locals.
H.R. Owen Ferrari London,"If the expensive clothes and products in other shops don't appeal, expensive cars are also available in this area."
King's Road,"One of London's smartest fashion streets, having evolved from the cutting-edge of bohemia and innovative fashion in the 60s to a more genteel place to indulge in retail therapy, albeit with a notable presence of trendy young Londoners (including many so called Sloane Rangers). It is a very attractive street that retains the atmosphere of a small town whilst being in the heart of a huge city. There is a huge range of fashion stores from upmarket chains to one-off boutiques, as well as variety of other shops, complimented by cafés, restaurants, bars, pubs and clubs. There is an obvious affluence to the road without any bling or snobbiness. King's Road stretches south-west from here for miles, though the best of the shopping is in the first mile."
Lamborghini London,"If you fancy a new car and have a lot of spare change, it might be worth a look. Poorer people are allowed to look at the shiny cars too."
Sloane Street,"Lined with high-end designer label stores, such as Chanel, Dior, Fendi, Gucci, Hermès, Jimmy Choo, Louis Vitton, and many more."
Whole Foods Market,The Kensington branch of this American chain of natural food supermarkets is the largest in the world.

Little Japan,Japanese restaurant and take-away between South Kensington station and the museums.
McDonald's,"This is just a McDonald's, pretty much the same as any other, but this one's easily remembered location and hours of operation make it a useful to know about."
Pop's,"Simple and straight-forward ""greasy spoon"" café for a good all-day breakfast or other budget meal."
Beirut Express,Part of the local Maroush chain of Lebanese restaurants based in Edgware Rd.
Da Mario,Popular family-run ristorante with great pizzas and Italian dishes. Come early or get on the waiting list or book in advance.

Great India Tandoori,One of Chelsea's most popular restaurants. Established by Satir Ahmed in 1960.
Kensington Creperie,"A small, cute, often crowded cafe and authentic French creperie, popular with the local French and various other South Ken expats. Given its location near the tube, it is a fine place to sit outside and watch the fashionable young people pass by."
La Bouchee,"Decent, reasonably priced French Restaurant."
The Pig's Ear,"Lively, old-world style pub/restaurant on Old Church Street. Acclaimed bistro fare and a wide selection of wines by the glass."
Sole Luna Pizza & Pasta,"This Italian bistro-style restaurant offers good food but the prices are too high compared to the rather bad service. The waiters, which change often, are not very attentive and almost yank the plates and glasses from the customer as soon as they have finished. The restaurant can be very busy due to its location, but the service leaves a lot to be desired."
Babylon,"Set amid Kensington Roof Gardens, seven floors above High Street Kensington station with a view over the city."
Bibendum,"Café, restaurant and oyster bar in Michelin House, an ornately tiled art nouveau building which belies the fact that it used to be a garage, albeit one catering to the few rich patrons who could afford an automobile in Edwardian London. Bibendum is the name of the character most commonly known as the Michelin Man."
Gordon Ramsay,"The original, flagship branch of the Ramsay empire. You are highly unlikely to find the man himself behind the stove these days, but this triple Michelin-starred eatery deserves its reputation as one of the finest on the planet. The lunch menu is just about affordable, but getting a reservation is problematic. Dress code applies."
Tom's Kitchen,"Populist spot for Tom Aikens's aptly named restaurant, albeit certainly in the ""Splurge"" category, the fish and chips make it certainly worth the difficulty getting reservations and the rather high cost."
Sloane Square Hotel,Modern restaurant/bar at the Sloane Square Hotel serving French cuisine. Popular lunch place for people working in the area.
Builders Arms,Gastropub near the Royal Marsden Hospital and just off the King's Rd.
Chelsea Potter,"Traditional pub fare, but when warm outside, best people watching spot around. Also, Aussie and Kiwi barmen solidify the awesome environment here."
Coopers Arms,"Great pints, including Peroni on tap. Best Sunday Roast around, and more of a gastropub than a traditional pub."
Maggie's,"80's themed nightclub. Named after 80's prime minister Margaret Thatcher, whose speeches can be heard playing in the toilets.  At the splurge level of costs, both to get in and at the bar."
The Phoenix,"Great pints, tremendous place for a pint on a sunny day. be sure to grab one of the outdoor tables and enjoy a cool pint on a hot day here (when not raining in London)."
Queens Head,LGBT traditional pub; real ale and standard pub food separates it from the trendier Kings Rd establishments.  Karaoke every other Saturday.
Courtfield,"CAMRA-listed gastropub, serving food and a range of beers."
Drayton Arms,A mix of traditional pub and bohemian nightspot. A good range of beer and slightly more upmarket than some other pubs in the area.
Gloucester Arms,Traditional pub.
The Prince of Teck,Traditional pub downstairs with a dining area on the first floor.
Troubadour Wines,"This cozy wine bar is a quieter alternative to the buzz next door.

Drink in or take home."
Zetland Arms,Traditional pub near South Kensington station.
Admiral Codrington,Gastropub.
The Antelope,Traditional pub with many original features preserved from its Georgian origin.
The Hour Glass,"This small, triangular, very easy-going pub just a little away from the main street bustle is a favorite among the locals, above all because the seating inside is designed to prevent overcrowding, but also for its pavement seating and upscale gastropub fare."

Park House Women's Hostel,Women only.  Single rooms with shared facilities.

Avonmore Hotel,"Popular three star hotel situated on Collingham Road between Earls Court and Kensington. The hotel offers 140 en-suite rooms, all with modern amenities. Book direct for best rates and low prices."
Chelsea House Hotel,"The staff is very gentle and helpful. It is clean, and the rooms are all right, they are a bit small, have fridge, a small TV, but no table. The hotel is not nice, but OK. The breakfast is uninteresting, except the coffee, which is awful! But, the tea and the juice are good. It is close to many pubs, cafés and shops. Good place to stay, but lots of traffic."
easyHotel Earl's Court,"Guests can only book an easyHotel on the website and rooms are priced on the basis of the earlier you book, the less you pay."
Eccleston Square Hotel,"Guests can only book an easyHotel on the website and rooms are priced on the basis of the earlier you book, the less you pay."

Houses of Parliament,"On the UNESCO World Heritage List, the Palace of Westminster is the seat of Parliament in the United Kingdom. It's often termed the ""Mother of All Parliaments"" - an exaggeration, but perhaps only a slight one. The present building largely dates from the 19th century when it was rebuilt following a fire in a splendid example of Victorian neo-Gothic architecture. The House of Commons (elected Members of Parliament or MPs) is located to the north of the building and is decorated with green leather upholstery, and the House of Lords (unelected Lords) is located to the south and decorated with red leather upholstery."
Summer Opening,"While the Houses are in recess, the Palace of Westminster is generally closed - apart from the long Summer recess, during which tours are run through the building, led by Parliamentary employees. Popularity of these tours means you're best advised to book in advance - a stall erected on the green opposite the Palace of Westminster on Millbank sells tickets in the Summer."
no tours for overseas visitors,"Strictly limited numbers of tickets are available to climb the Elizabeth Tower, which was renamed from Clock Tower in 2012. It contains the Great Bell, commonly known as Big Ben. British visitors should write to their Member of Parliament to request tickets. Unfortunately there are no tours for overseas visitors."
The Jewel Tower,"This small tower across the road from the Houses of Parliament is the only part of the original Palace of Westminster still standing. While it is overshadowed in splendour by the surrounding buildings, it's well worth a visit, and has good displays about the early history of Westminster."
State Opening of Parliament,"Probably the most colourful event in the UK's legislative calendar, this takes place in May or June every year, or after a general election, when the Queen travels to the Houses of Parliament to open the new parliamentary session. During this event, the lords and other office holders can be seen dressed in their ceremonial robes, and there is always an elaborate procession when the Queen makes her way to the Houses of Parliament from Buckingham Palace. Many traditions of the State Opening can trace their origins to a more turbulent past, when the relationship between the monarch and Parliament was sometimes antagonistic. In particular, since the English Civil War, the monarch has been banned from entering the House of Commons chamber, and instead must send a representative to summon the MPs to the Lords chamber, where she delivers her speech."
Buckingham Palace,"The main residence of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II (reigned since 1952, coronated 1953). Other residences include Sandringham House, Windsor Castle, Holyrood Palace and Balmoral Castle. These other residences are generally easier to visit (open more days and less queues), and also of interest is the former Royal Yacht Britannia in Edinburgh where the Queen's bedroom can be seen.In the summer, 19 State Rooms are open to the public, while the Queen is staying at her Scottish palace at Balmoral. Places are strictly limited, and it might not be possible to just turn up and get a ticket for a specific entry time, visitors should really book in advance to ensure admission."
St James's Palace,The most senior of the Royal palaces in London (built between 1531 and 1536) and the official seat of the monarch.
The Guards Museum,The most senior of the Royal palaces in London (built between 1531 and 1536) and the official seat of the monarch.

St. Margaret's Church,"St. Margaret's is the church of the British Parliament, more specifically, the parish church of the House of Commons."
Westminster Abbey,"Note that the Abbey itself charges tourists for entry, but not for worshippers. Attend a church service for free and enjoy some of the finest choral music in London from the choir. Choral Evensong at 3pm (Sa Su) or 5pm (weekdays), depending on time of year, is an especially good bet. The Abbey is the traditional scene for the Coronation of British monarchs and the burial place of many past kings and queens. The Abbey contains a good gift shop and the Cellarium Café, which traces its history to the 14th century, is a good place to buy a noontime meal.  Westminster Abbey is usually open to visitors from Monday to Saturday throughout the year. On Sundays and religious holidays such as Easter and Christmas, the Abbey is open for worship only. All are welcome and it is free to attend services.  Visitor access to the Abbey is via the West Gate of the North Green."
Tate Britain,"This gallery houses the Tate collection of British art from 1500 through to contemporary art.

Green Park,"In contrast to the other Royal Parks in the area, Green Park can seem a little plain.  It has no lakes or buildings and few monuments.  It is still a pleasant green, lightly wooded, area in the centre of London, neighbouring two other parks and Buckingham Palace."
St. James's Park,The oldest of the Royal Parks of London.
Wellington Arch,"The Arch was designed in the 1820s by Decimus Burton as a Roman-style triumphal arch to commemorate victory in the Napoleonic Wars; although money ran out before it was completed.  Adrian Jones' chariot statue on the top, ""Peace descending on the Quadriga of War"", was added in 1912.  The original equestrian statue, added in 1846, was widely disliked and now stands in Aldershot.  The arch is now owned by English Heritage and is open to the public: it contains exhibits about the arch and English history, while the view from the top is quite impressive."
Duke of Wellington,"Equestrian statue of the Iron Duke, with four soldiers at each corner of the pedestal, representing regiments that fought under him: a Grenadier, Scottish Highlander, Irish Dragoon, and Welsh Fusilier.  The bronze came from melting down captured French cannons."

Westminster Cathedral,"The brick and stone Catholic Cathedral (not to be confused with the much more famous Westminster Abbey) is near Victoria Station, just off Victoria Street. Construction started in 1895, and some of the interior is still unfinished. Worth a quick visit if you are passing."
Banqueting House,"Designed and built in 1619-1622 by the Neo-Classical architect Inigo Jones, The Banqueting House is now all that remains of Whitehall Palace, the sovereign's principal residence from 1530-1698 when most of it was destroyed by fire. Renowned for its architecture and paintings (by Rubens, among others), the building is also famous for being the scene of Charles I's execution in 1649 at the end of the English Civil War."
Cabinet War Rooms and Churchill Museum,"A branch of the Imperial War Museum, the Cabinet War Rooms preserves the underground corridors and rooms from which Churchill and the cabinet directed the war against Hitler and the Nazis, maintained almost exactly as they were left in 1945. In 1984, IWM opened the rooms to the public for the first time.  In 2005, the attached Churchill Museum was opened as the world's first permanent museum dedicated to the life and wartime achievements of Sir Winston Churchill.  Audio guides are included in your admission.  No cloakroom, no rucksacks, no suitcases.  Café is open daily from 10am to 5pm. Hot food is served until 3pm."

In the centre of the street sits the Cenotaph, a war memorial erected following World War I, which is the centre of the annual Remembrance Day ceremony on 11 November."
Changing of the Guard,"Each morning between May and July at 11:30 the guard changes outside Buckingham Palace. The rest of the year, the guard changes on alternate days, weather permitting. A board is placed outside the palace in the morning to say whether the Changing of the Guard ceremony will take place or not. There is no charge to view the Changing of the Guard—simply turn up and stand at the fence in front of the Palace, but it is worth getting there early to ensure a good view, particularly when the weather is fine."
Changing of the Guard,"Each morning the guard is also changed at Horse Guards Parade.  As this changing of the guard is less famous than the Buckingham Palace affair, the crowds are usually smaller; plus there are no railings here to spoil the view.  The ceremony does not take place in very wet weather.  The cavalry are based at Hyde Park Barracks and can be seen proceeding through the park, under the Wellington Arch, along Constitution Hill and The Mall each morning."
Dismounting Ceremony,"In the late afternoon at Horse Guards an officer will inspect the guards, after which the mounted sentries return their horses to the stables for the night.  They are replaced by two dismounted sentries.  This ceremony was born as a punishment detail in 1894 but it was retained as a tradition when the 100-year punishment period ended in the 1990s."
Trooping the Colour,"A ceremony performed by regiments of the British and Commonwealth armies to mark the official birthday of the Queen.  The Queen travels by carriage down The Mall from Buckingham Palace to Horse Guards Parade, where she inspects the troops and then entire Household Division performs a march past the Queen as she receives their salute. Tickets to Horse Guards Parade are awarded by ballot but the parade along the rest of the route can be watched for free.  Up to three tickets can be requested by sending a letter (this is by post only), enclosing a self-addressed envelope, to the Brigade Major of the Headquarters Household Division, in January or February; these will be entered into the ballot and those chosen will be sent offer letters which contain payment details.  Those without a ticket can get their best view by standing on The Mall, along the edge of the parade, or on the edge of St James's Park by Horse Guards Parade.  Arriving before 09:00 is recommended."
Major General's Review,Tickets are made available by the same ballot as Trooping the Colour.
Colonel's Review,Tickets are made available by the same ballot as Trooping the Colour.
Beating Retreat,"This was originally a 16th-century tradition for recalling troops to a castle at sunset before the gates closed.  Today, the ceremony has evolved into a military pageant of music and precision drilling, while also serving as practice for military bands.  The proceeds from ticket sales go to charity."

The Grenadier,An oddly quiet and secluded pub in the centre of the city due to being tucked away in a side street of another side steet.  It was built in 1720 as an officer's mess for the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards and became a pub in 1818.  The pub is said to be haunted by the ghost of a junior officer who was caught cheating at cards and flogged to death.
The Star Tavern,"One of only two London pubs (and seven nationally) to feature in every edition of CAMRA's Good Beer Guide since its first publication; see The Buckingham Arms for the other one.  The pub has a seedy past—it was infamous as a hangout for gang bosses and crime lords in the 1950s and 60s, and the Great Train Robbery was planned here, and celebrities of the era would come to socialise with the criminals. Today it is a safer, friendlier and more comfortable establishment that has recently been refurbished."

Monday to Saturday, gourmet burgers are served by Forty Burgers; with traditional British roasts on Sundays."

The pub is said to be haunted by the ghosts of prisoners who didn't last long enough for the journey.  For the living, the pub is next to the bank of the Thames and very close to the Tate gallery."
The Albert,"A nice, but often crowded, traditional pub, dating back to the 1860s, named in honour of Queen Victoria's husband. Portraits of British prime ministers, many of them signed, hang on the stairwell, and Chelsea pensioners (British war veterans) can often be seen propping up the bar."
The Buckingham Arms,One of only two London pubs (and seven nationally) to feature in every edition of CAMRA's Good Beer Guide since its first publication; see The Star Tavern for the other one. The building is a refitted early Victorian pub.
The Cask and Glass,"Small traditional pub (one of the smallest in central London, in fact). Good beers and quaint interior."
Wetherspoons,"A pub that doesn't even have its own name and may be missed by many of the two hundred thousand commuters and travellers who pass it each day, this place nevertheless serves good beer and food (it's part of the J D Wetherspoon chain). There is additional seating on the balconies on either side of the pub. Given its location, it also displays departure boards on its own screens."
