      "[[[<b>Art Institute of Chicago</b>, <b>Modern Wing</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">111 S Michigan Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">One of the premier museums in the U.S. \\u2014 and with the opening of the sensational new <b>Modern Wing</b>, it's one of the largest, too. Set aside a whole day and arrive early! Iconic pieces on display include \"American Gothic\" by Grant Wood (the stoic farm couple), \"Nighthawks\" by Edward Hopper (the late-night diner), Georges Seurat's pointillist masterpiece \"Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte\". The Art Institute also boasts the world's best collection of Impressionist painting outside of France. But there's a lot more to discover, including a great selection of early 20th-century painting, architecture, and photography, as well as archaeological finds covering 5,000 years of art and cultural history.</bdi>]], [[<b>Federal Reserve Bank Money Museum</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">230 S LaSalle St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Currency wonks can study various denominations and practice counterfeit detections. Guided tours every day at 1PM.</bdi>]], [[<b>Museum of Contemporary Photography</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">600 S Michigan Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A stimulating and innovative forum for the collection, creation, and examination of contemporary image-making in its camera tradition and in its expanded vocabulary of digital processes. Affiliated with Columbia College Chicago.</bdi>]], [[<b>Pritzker Military Museum &amp; Library</b>], [], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A museum and a research library for the study of military history</bdi>]], [[<b>Spertus Institute</b>, <b>Asher Library</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">610 S Michigan Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A museum dedicated to Jewish culture and learning, in a dramatic, newly remodeled facility. There's a children's center, which promises hands-on exhibits, and a regular slate of exhibits and events on Jewish art, culture, and social issues, with points given for range that includes the Israeli-Palestinian Comedy Tour <i>and</i> lectures on Jewish-Catholic relations. The <b>Asher Library</b>, also on-site, keeps different hours (Su-Th afternoons).</bdi>]], [[<b>Grant Park</b>, <b>Petrillo Bandshell</b>, <b>Buckingham Fountain</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">On the east side of Michigan Ave between Lake Shore Dr and Columbus Dr</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Right at the center of Chicago, this has been a park space for almost the entire history of the city. Most citywide events and festivals (see <a href=\"/wiki/Chicago#Events_&amp;_Festivals\" title=\"Chicago\">below</a>) are held in Grant Park and the <b>Petrillo Bandshell</b>. The centerpiece of the park is <b>Buckingham Fountain</b> (10AM-11PM), which is sometimes accompanied by music and colored lights (8-11PM, May-Sep). There are also tennis courts, softball fields, and a walking trail near the lake. Millennium Park is to the north and the <a href=\"/wiki/Chicago/Near_South\" title=\"Chicago/Near South\">Museum Campus</a> is to the south, so there is a large area to wander.</bdi>]], [[<b>Millennium Park</b>, <b>The Bean</b>, <b>Cloud Gate</b>, <b>Pritzker Pavilion</b>, <b>Crown Fountain</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">On the E side of Michigan Ave btwn Randolph St and the Art Institute</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Long before it opened, Millennium Park had become notorious for delays and cost-overruns, missing its titular date by a wide margin. However, when it was finally finished in 2004, the biggest shock of all came when it turned out to be quite nice. Aside from plenty of grass and open space, it has modern sculptures in steel and glass, including Chicago's newest must-photo for visitors, <b>The Bean</b> (properly known as <b>Cloud Gate</b>), and the Frank Gehry-designed <b>Pritzker Pavilion</b> for outdoor concerts. Kids will love getting wet in the <b>Crown Fountain</b> (mid-April to the end of summer) at Michigan and Monroe, in which the giant projected faces of Chicago residents spit water into a shallow reflecting pool where everyone is welcome to splash around. Look for tents offering guides to the park near the entrances at Randolph and/or Washington. From mid-November to early March there is an ice skating rink open to the public (weather permitting) located on Michigan Avenue between Washington and Madison Streets. The McCormick Tribune Ice Rink opens at Noon on weekdays and 10AM on Saturdays and Sundays with free admission (skate rental is 12$, locker rental is 1$).</bdi>]], [[<b>Vietnam Veterans Memorial</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2 E Wacker Dr</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Designed in coordination with the National Vietnam Veterans Art Museum in the <a href=\"/wiki/Chicago/Near_South\" title=\"Chicago/Near South\">Near South</a>, this waterfront plaza features a timeline from the war, a list of Illinois veterans who were killed in action, and a nice vantage point toward a few iconic buildings down the river. After crossing over the river from the <a href=\"/wiki/Chicago/Near_North\" title=\"Chicago/Near North\">Near North</a>, turn and take the stairs down to the lower level.</bdi>]], [[<b>Chicago Cultural Center</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">78 E Washington St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Built in 1897 as Chicago's first public library, the building now houses the city's Visitor Information Center, galleries, and exhibit halls. Worth a visit to see the beautiful interior \\u2014 the ceiling of Preston Bradley Hall includes a 38-foot Tiffany glass dome, and the north wing includes the impressive Grand Army of the Republic Rotunda. Of late, amid various city-approved art and music events, some surprisingly good theater has been performed here.</bdi>]], [[<b>Chicago Mercantile Exchange Visitors Center</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">20 S Wacker Dr</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">The 4th Floor Visitor Gallery is currently closed.</bdi>]], [[<b>The Skydeck</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">233 S Wacker Dr</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Once the tallest building in the world, the Sears Tower now has to settle for second-highest in the Americas alone, behind <a href=\"/wiki/New_York_City\" title=\"New York City\">New York City</a>'s One World Trade Center (and even those are after a semantic battle with <a href=\"/wiki/Toronto\" title=\"Toronto\">Toronto</a> and the CN Tower). The Hancock Observatory (see <a href=\"/wiki/Chicago/Near_North\" title=\"Chicago/Near North\">Near North</a>) has a nicer view of the city, but the Sears Tower offers an incredible view of its own from \"The Ledge\", which lets visitors walk out in a transparent balcony suspended 1,353 feet above the street. To avoid the crowds, visit after 4PM.</bdi>]], [[<b>Chicago Architecture Foundation</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">224 S Michigan Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Runs numerous river cruises and themed architecture walks covering the Loop and other parts of the city, with offerings suitable for general audiences and people with specific interests. There are some small, informative exhibits inside their 224 S Michigan headquarters and a gift shop. Walking tours are usually $15, $12 for students/seniors.</bdi>]], [[<b>Carbide and Carbon Building</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">230 N Michigan Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A beautiful Art Deco tower covered in dark green terra cotta and adorned with a gold terra cotta leaf at the pinnacle. It is rumored that the architects (the sons of city planner Daniel Burnham) intended the building to resemble a bottle of champagne. It's in great condition today, and can be visited through one of the bars in the lobby of the hotel inside.</bdi>]], [[<b>Federal Center</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">219/230 S Dearborn St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">This plaza includes Mies' Dirksen Federal Building and Kluczynski Federal Building (built eleven years apart), with a low-rise post office enveloped in their sleek black lines. But the buildings are not quite as famous as the gigantic red constructivist flamingo statue by Alexander Calder in the plaza in front of the post office. An adventurous raccoon may have set a raccoon world climbing record by reaching the scaffolding on the 36th floor in 2006.</bdi>]], [[<b>The Fine Arts Building</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">412 S Michigan Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">An old Michigan Avenue charmer whose worn stone walls looks even older than its 120+ years. Even though few artists could afford to keep studios on Michigan Avenue these days, it still has a creative air, thanks to the fanciful carvings on the walls, and an inviting snack shop on the first floor.</bdi>]], [[<b>The Gage Group</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">18-30 S Michigan Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Louis Sullivan designed the northernmost (18) of the three buildings here, and the team of Holabird &amp; Roche added the next two (24 &amp; 30). The roots of Mies-style modernism are easily apparent in the immaculate proportions here, although Sullivan's piers overflow like water-pipes with ornament at the top, and Holabird &amp; Roche's two make an interesting contrast with the master.</bdi>]], [[<b>The Haskell Building</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">18 S Wabash Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Originally designed by John Mills van Osdel, the city's first accredited architect after the Chicago Fire, this four-story building is one of the oldest in the Loop. The two bottom floors were remodeled by Louis Sullivan in 1896, adding some interesting cast-iron designs for its use as a department store.</bdi>]], [[<b>The Jewelers' Building</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">15-17 S Wabash Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Louis Sullivan was only a draftsman at the time this was built, but there are some interesting designs nestled into expressive fa\\xe7ade and the classic, powerful masonry walls.</bdi>]], [[<b>Marquette Building</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">140 S Dearborn</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">It's partially obscured by renovations, but this first-wave skyscraper still makes an immediate contrast with the modern Federal Center across the street. The lobby is decorated with Tiffany mosaics and bronze carvings of Pere Marquette, an early French explorer. There is plenty of first-floor retail to allow trips inside.</bdi>]], [[<b>Monadnock Building</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">53 W Jackson Blvd</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Named appropriately for a mountain in <a href=\"/wiki/New_Hampshire\" title=\"New Hampshire\">New Hampshire</a>, the Monadnock was the last tall building to be supported by its own walls (not a metal frame, although the 1893 addition by Holabird &amp; Roche does use one). It's a masterpiece of simplicity and power in form. The block-long hallway that serves as a lobby has incredible ambiance: it's always kept at a level of brightness that suggests gas lamps, and the small stores on the first floor (a coffee shop, a shoe-shine, a restaurant) are all turn-of-the-century tile-and-polish.</bdi>]], [[<b>The Reliance Building</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">36 N State St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A then-unprecedented amount of glass was used in this early skyscraper, bewildering a public still used to masonry walls. Note the difference between the first two floors and the ones above: hold-outs among the previous building's tenants forced developers to build the foundation and the first two floors <i>under</i> the top three floors from the old building, and then knock off the top three when their leases had expired. It was restored when it became the Hotel Burnham (see <a href=\"/wiki/Chicago/Loop#Sleep\" title=\"Chicago/Loop\">below</a>) in 1999, and can be explored with a stop at the Atwood Cafe (also <a href=\"/wiki/Chicago/Loop#Eat\" title=\"Chicago/Loop\">below</a>).</bdi>]], [[<b>The Rookery</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">209 S LaSalle St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">The Rookery is gorgeous to the point of absurdity, with delight to be found in details in the rustic lower walls and the triumphant upper walls. (Note the helpful street names carved in the corners.) Named for pigeons' habit of roosting in the then-new skyscrapers, this was the first Loop building to be granted preservation status in 1972. The lobby was remodeled in 1907 by <i>enfant terrible</i> Frank Lloyd Wright, adding his own touch to the interior.</bdi>]], [[<b>311 S Wacker Dr</b>], [], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">961 ft. For a time this was the tallest building in the world without an official name, although locals know exactly what to call it: The White Castle Building. It is distinctive for its \"crown,\" which is brightly illuminated at night. If you are nearby, head into its lobby to see its enormous indoor garden and fountain.</bdi>]], [[<b>Aon Center</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">200 E Randolph St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">1136\\xa0ft. Originally known as the Standard Oil Building, The Aon Center is <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_of_America\" title=\"United States of America\">America's</a> fourth tallest building from base to roof, after the Empire State Building in <a href=\"/wiki/New_York_City\" title=\"New York City\">New York</a>, and fifteenth tallest in the world by architectural detail. It was built in 1972 by architect Edward Stone and initially was faced with marble, but the windy city began to blow the marble off the sides of the building. The entire building had to be refaced with granite \\u2014 a costly job at one-half of the entire building costs! A walk around the base can be particularly gratifying to admire the uninterrupted views straight up the shear walls and the \"musical sculptures.\"</bdi>]], [[<b>Aqua</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">225 N Columbus Dr</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">823 ft. The biggest American project ever to be headed by a woman, Jeanne Gang's skyscraper was named the world's best new building by Emporis when it opened in 2009 (four spots ahead of the Trump Tower across the river). Its most distinguishing feature is its series of undulating balconies, which extend as far as twelve feet from the building's walls, giving the building a surreal \"rippling\" effect. It uses an unforgettable curtain wall that compliments wavy balconies. Though impressive from any angle, it's best viewed relative to the water \\u2014 either from a boat tour or the riverwalk over in the <a href=\"/wiki/Chicago/Near_North\" title=\"Chicago/Near North\">Near North</a>.</bdi>]], [[<b>AT&amp;T Corporate Center</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">227 W Monroe St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">1007\\xa0ft. Built by Adrian Smith in 1989, the granite-clad AT&amp;T Corporate Center is one of the city's more distinctive skyscrapers for its massive size, spiked roof pinnacles, and a style evocative of both Gothic and Japanese architectural styles. It's not well-known, but it is the eighth tallest building in the U.S.</bdi>]], [[<b>Chase Tower</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">21 S Clark St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">850\\xa0ft. Located at the exact center of CTA's Loop transit system, this building is distinctive for its vertical curve. It has been renamed for each of the successive banks that have bought out its previous tenants \\u2014 for example, it was the BankOne Tower until 2005. The plaza outside is more interesting than the interior \\u2014 it is home to an enormous mosaic by renowned Russian painter Marc Chagall.</bdi>]], [[<b>Daley Center</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">55 W Washington St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">648\\xa0ft. The 1965 Daley Center is Chicago's principal civic center and boasts a gigantic <a href=\"/wiki/Loop_Art_Tour\" title=\"Loop Art Tour\">Picasso statue</a> on the adjacent plaza. A true Chicago landmark, the Daley Center was featured in <i>The Blues Brothers</i>, who drive across Daley Plaza and crash through the glass walls of the building. The Mies-esque design was <i>intended</i> to age visibly: the color has faded in a rust-like direction from exposure to the elements.</bdi>]], [[<b>Metropolitan Correctional Center</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">71 W Van Buren St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">287\\xa0ft. While not very tall, this 1975 brutalist structure is one of the most distinctive and curious in the Chicago skyline. As its name suggests, it is a vertical prison skyscraper and its sharp triangular shape is designed to minimize the amount of time that it takes to patrol its corridors. Its prisoners have some of the prison world's best views as their exercise yard is located on top of the roof, although the narrow slits serving as windows do not allow such nice views from the cells. The prison houses male and female convicts of all security levels, waiting for transport to the courthouse nearby.</bdi>]], [[<b>Crain Communications Building</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">150 N Michigan Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">582 ft. Anyone who has seen <i>Adventures in Babysitting</i> should immediately recognize this 1984 building, as its slanted roof (lit up at night) played a very important role in the film's climax. It's a hard building to miss, as it is just across the street from Millennium Park.</bdi>]], [[<b>The Auditorium Theatre</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">50 E Congress Pkwy</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Dankmar Adler and Louis Sullivan's masterpiece. Frank Lloyd Wright, who served as an apprentice on the project, called it \"The greatest room for music and opera in the world \\u2014 bar none.\" If the current production isn't worth seeing, take a tour of this gorgeous, acoustically-perfect theater instead. Tours are available at various times and days depending on the season.</bdi>]], [[<b>Cadillac Palace Theater</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">151 W Randolph St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A Broadway in Chicago outlet, this opulent theater was built in 1926 for the vaudeville circuit and is now glossed up for high-profile productions with 2,300 seats per show. <i>The Producers</i> and the mighty Oprah's <i>The Color Purple</i> both enjoyed long runs here.</bdi>]], [[<b>Chicago Symphony Orchestra</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">220 S Michigan Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Home of Chicago's renowned orchestra; they spend a lot of time on the road, though, so visiting orchestras and stately jazz concerts can also be found here, as can the occasional curveball like a silent film.</bdi>]], [[<b>Chicago Theater</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">175 N State St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">An old Balaban &amp; Katz movie palace, refurbished as one of the city's premier performance venues. It hosts a wide range of events, from spoken word and stand-up comedy to jazz, gospel, and rock. Most people, however, know it for the iconic marquee out front.</bdi>]], [[<b>Ford Center for the Performing Arts</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">24 W Randolph St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">The Oriental Theater was once Chicago's most ornate movie palace, but this is now another Broadway in Chicago theater outlet.</bdi>]], [[<b>Goodman Theater</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">170 N Dearborn St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Non-profit theater company in an extremely expensive space; they pride themselves on new works, but are better known for revivals of plays from the American theater canon. Post-show discussions with the cast are held after Wednesday and Thursday night performances.</bdi>]], [[<b>PrivateBank Theater</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">18 W Monroe St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Another Broadway in Chicago theater. Founded in 1906 to attract a classier vaudeville crowd, it saw performances from Harry Houdini, and was run by New York theater impresario Sam Shubert for more than forty-five years. <i>Monty Python's Spamalot</i> and <i>High School Musical</i> have been here more recently.</bdi>]], [[<b>Lyric Opera</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">20 N Wacker Dr</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Extraordinary productions of major operas, in the impressive Civic Opera House, overlooking the river; local legend has it that the back-story behind business magnate Samuel Insull's decision to build it was the inspiration for the opera scenes in <i>Citizen Kane</i>. Although highly acclaimed today, there was a minor controversy among purists when they began to project English titles above the stage for non-English operas.</bdi>]], [[<b>Saint Patrick's Day Parade</b>], [], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Chicago has a large Irish-American population, and it's one that punches above its weight \\u2014 St Patrick's Day is a huge affair in the Windy City. The endless parade takes place on Columbus Drive along the Chicago River, which is dyed green for the occasion. The river dyeing is at 10:45AM, and the parade starts at noon. Note that these festivities take place on the Saturday <i>before</i> the holiday.</bdi>]], [[<b>Gospel Fest</b>], [], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">The world's biggest free outdoor gospel festival is in Grant Park! Like the Blues Fest, the performers are a combination of national and local acts. Chicago has a thriving gospel scene and this is one of the best ways to experience it for the uninitiated.</bdi>]], [[<b>Blues Fest</b>], [], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Top national and local blues musicians perform all day long throughout the festival just a couple miles from where modern blues was born. This is the world's premiere blues festival, and the list of greats who have performed here (like Albert King, B.B. King, Buddy Guy, Chuck Berry, Etta James, John Lee Hooker, Memphis Slim, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Willie Dixon) gets more impressive each successive year. Admission is free and the performances are spread out across six stages throughout Grant Park.</bdi>]], [[<b>Taste of Chicago</b>], [], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">An outdoor showcase of Chicago restaurants, vendors, and performers, plus big name concerts. The specifics of the scheme vary from year to year, but generally, you buy a roll of tickets and then trade in those tickets for beer, drinks, food, and desserts. It's a great chance to sample the range of <a href=\"/wiki/Chicago#Eat\" title=\"Chicago\">Chicago cuisine</a> (at steeper prices). Also a great opportunity to watch Independence Day fireworks from the park and lakefront, but beware: it gets <i>crowded</i>.</bdi>]], [[<b>Grant Park Music Festival</b>], [], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Chicago is spoiled for free music in the summer \\u2014 the excellent Grant Park Symphony Orchestra plays in Millennium Park's Pritzker Pavilion about three times per week June\\u2013August, usually W,F Sa. The symphony is hardly the only free show at the Pritzker Pavilion, though, and it's worth walking by on any night around 6:30PM to see if any other classical, dance, etc. performances are running.</bdi>]], [[<b>Lollapalooza</b>], [], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Formerly a traveling tour, Lollapalooza has now found a permanent location in Chicago and grown quite a bit. It's a <i>massive</i> three day collection of popular and lesser-known national and local rock and hip hop bands.</bdi>]], [[<b>Jazz Fest</b>], [], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">The great Chicago Jazz Festival was inaugurated in 1974 just weeks after Duke Ellington's death to commemorate his life's work, and has since become one of the world's largest annual jazz festivals, pulling some of the biggest names in the jazz world each year. And this one is free. If you have the means, you might want to come earlier in the week \\u2014 there are usually a host of jazz-related events in the run up to the festival.</bdi>]], [[<b>Central Camera</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">230 S Wabash Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">As the name suggests, this is a centrally-located place to deal with fussy cameras or upgrade to better ones. They've been in business since 1899, and have an awe-inspiring amount of spare and obsolete parts from over the years in storage, so don't be shy about asking for something you can't find anywhere else.</bdi>]], [[<b>Graham Crackers</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">77 E Madison St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Comic book store right off Michigan Avenue. The staff aren't much of a treat, but the comic selection isn't bad.</bdi>]], [[<b>Jeweler's Center</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">5 S Wabash Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">An estimated 185 jewelers in one building by the elevated tracks give this a Wild West atmosphere \\u2014 you could leave with a terrific deal, or...</bdi>]], [[<b>Nordstrom Rack</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">24 N State St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">The outlet store for the <a href=\"/wiki/Chicago/Near_North\" title=\"Chicago/Near North\">Near North</a> retailer. There's plenty of heavily-discounted merchandise, but shoes are where the serious mania lies.</bdi>]], [[<b>Wabash Jewelers Mall</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">21 N Wabash Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">The other bastion of Jeweler's Row, with several stores that specialize in loose diamonds.</bdi>]], [[<b>Artist's Cafe</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">412 S Michigan Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">In the beautiful old Fine Arts Building, this is easily the best outdoor seating in the Loop. It's sort of a diner with beer and wine also on the menu. The food and service are mediocre at best, but it's reasonably priced, brilliantly located, and more popular with the Columbia College students than it is touristy.</bdi>]], [[<b>Beef &amp; Brandy</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">127 S State St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A nice spot to get good food at reasonable prices in the Loop \\u2014 a good rib-eye steak here is just $15 (it's certainly the only place downtown to get a full diner breakfast for under $5). Best to be appraised that karaoke and DJs at the bar can make Wednesday-Friday nights a bit loud during dinner.</bdi>]], [[<b>Boni Vino</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">111 W Van Buren St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Boni Vino, in addition to its pasta dishes, serves what is probably the best Chicago style thin crust pizza downtown \\u2014 a good option if you want pizza, but fear the cholesterol-laden stuffed pizzas at Bella Bacino's. In addition to good pizza, this restaurant has lots of character and surprisingly low prices.</bdi>]], [[<b>Garrett Popcorn</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">4 E Madison St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Whether Garrett's shout-out-loud delicious popcorn is the cap to a good lunch or composes the entire meal is up to you and your conscience. \"The Mix\" is equal parts caramel- and cheese-coated popcorn; strange as it sounds, the combination is addictive. Sales went mad after an appearance on Oprah, so expect lines. There are a few other Loop stores, including 26 W Randolph and 2 W Jackson, but this is the most centrally located. Nice as it would be, signs warn that you can't bring Garrett's into the nearby theaters with you.</bdi>]], [[<b>Heaven on Seven</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">111 N Wabash Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">If you are downtown when the craving hits for some down home comfort food, this is the place to go. While the South Side remains the undisputed home of soul food in Chicago, this place holds its own. Heaven even boasts a floor length wall of hot sauces.</bdi>]], [[<b>Luke's Italian Beef</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">215 W Jackson Blvd</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Luke's is where it's at for Italian Beef sandwiches in the Loop, and it's right next to the Sears Tower. The quality is a little unreliable at Luke's, but when they're on, they serve some of the best beef in the city. Hold the enormous portions of fries though, if you have any sympathy for your circulatory system.</bdi>]], [[<b>Osaka Express</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">400 S Michigan Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A counter on a corner of Michigan Avenue with good, cheap seafood and vegetarian sushi. Be prepared for blank stares if you try ordering in Japanese, though.</bdi>]], [[<b>Perry's</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">174 N Franklin St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Absurdly huge sandwiches (including nine triple-deckers) and cheerful service. The lines at lunch are long, but you'll notice the way the regulars are content to wait for as long as it takes, knowing what's coming to them. (You'll also notice the prohibition against cell phones on the premises.) If in doubt, try \"Perry's Favorite,\" a corned beef special named for the original owner's sandwich of choice.</bdi>]], [[<b>Backstage Bistro</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">180 N Wabash Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Somewhere between a restaurant and a classroom, the chefs and servers here are culinary arts students from the Illinois Institute of Art. The students are enthusiastic, and accordingly do a much better job than most \"professionals\" at the borderline tourist traps that proliferate around this section of town. Fine dining at very low prices, and you can even watch the chefs-in-training at work behind the kitchen's glass walls. It's small, so make reservations.</bdi>]], [[<b>Bella Bacino's</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">75 E Wacker Dr</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Very good Italian food and simply incredible stuffed pizza.</bdi>]], [[<b>Cellars Market</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">141 W Jackson Blvd</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A hidden gem serving breakfast and lunch only, this cafeteria closes soon after the trading floors upstairs do. Made-to-order deli sandwiches, homemade soups, a large salad bar, and daily specials prepared on-site. The turkey club sandwich is enormous, especially if you're polite and cheerful toward the person making it.</bdi>]], [[<b>Petterino's</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">150 N Dearborn St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Petterino's is a classic Chicago restaurant, serving high quality steaks, salads, and seafood dishes. The restaurant caters to the theater-going crowd, and reservations for dinner are wise.</bdi>]], [[<b>Pizano's</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">61 E Madison St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">The closest deep dish pizza to Millennium Park and the Art Institute. Pizano's has roots in the family that produced UNO's and Lou Malnati's, but will serve a worthy thin-crust, too.</bdi>]], [[<b>Ronny's Original Steakhouse</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">100 W Randolph St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">There are far better steakhouses in downtown Chicago, but Ronny's earns points for being so dirt cheap. Friendly Midwestern service, diner atmosphere, and huge cuts of meat at low prices. They lost the classic, gritty, shadows-of-the-L atmosphere when they moved here from Wabash, but a good greasy spoon is still a good greasy spoon.</bdi>]], [[<b>Aria</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">200 N Columbus Dr</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Fine dining in a romantic space attached to the Fairmont Hotel, offering what it describes as \"culturally inspired, comfortably American\" cuisine.</bdi>]], [[<b>Atwood Cafe</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">1 W Washington St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Popular restaurant with a bar in the classic Hotel Burnham. Good location and atmosphere for dinner before a show.</bdi>]], [[<b>Everest</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">440 S LaSalle St, 40F</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Arguably the best restaurant in Chicago. The \"Personal French Cuisine\" of Executive Chef Jean Joho is world-renowned. The view from the top floor of the Chicago Stock Exchange is magnificent as well. Complimentary valet parking.</bdi>]], [[<b>Russian Tea Time</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">77 E Adams St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">This is <i>the</i> place to try Russian cuisine in Chicago! Easily one of the best Russian restaurants in the world with an inventive menu and excellent management. Ask to be seated in the front section. Afternoon tea runs from 2:30-4:30PM.</bdi>]], [[<b>Trattoria No.10</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">10 N Dearborn St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A gourmet Italian restaurant; dinners are designed to include a <i>primi piatti</i> course of pasta and a <i>secondi piatti</i> of duck, veal, and other seasonal specialties, although they can be ordered separately.</bdi>]], [[<b>Vivere</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">71 W Monroe St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">One of Chicago's top Italian restaurants, with very creative decor and a romantic ambiance.</bdi>]], [[<b>BIG Bar</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">151 E Wacker Dr</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Don't expect an intimate atmosphere or anything resembling a classic Chicago experience. Do expect all things comically out of proportion. The bar is 160 feet long and the margaritas can get so big that they actually mix them in a cement mixer. And the view is great.</bdi>]], [[<b>Close Up 2</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">416 S Clark St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A classy lounge that may be the best place in the city to relax and listen to smooth jazz. The client\\xe8le is similarly classy, so come well dressed (business casual) and looking good.</bdi>]], [[<b>Elephant &amp; Castle</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">111 W Adams St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">English-ish pub chain with the requisite fish &amp; chips and other mid-range pub food, long hours, and a second location at 185 N Wabash. It's a good place for a long stay.</bdi>]], [[<b>Emerald Loop</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">216 N Wabash Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Irish-style pub in a elegant setting, with large tables to accommodate business lunches. The food's good, breakfast included.</bdi>]], [[<b>Exchequer Restaurant &amp; Pub</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">226 S Wabash Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Family-friendly pub with pizza and ribs, under the L tracks and covered in Chicago memorabilia.</bdi>]], [[<b>Miller's Pub</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">134 S Wabash Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Established in 1935 and bursting with faded celebrity photos, Miller's Pub serves ribs, steak, and sandwiches with its list of beer, wine, and martinis. It's a little too formal to sprawl out and relax, but perfect if getting a beer is a task of equal import to dinner.</bdi>]], [[<b>Plymouth Restaurant &amp; Bar</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">327 S Plymouth Ct</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">The Plymouth Restaurant is merely an adequate cafe serving diner-style food, but come here instead for the rooftop bar. Sipping a cocktail while gazing off the balcony at the Harold Washington Library and various Louis Sullivan masterpieces is a fine way to cap off a day of sightseeing, provided that the blaring music doesn't drive you away.</bdi>]], [[<b>Stocks &amp; Blondes Bar &amp; Grille</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">40 N Wells St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Stocks &amp; Blondes, aside from the frightening pun, is a rarity in the Loop in that it is \"just a bar.\" No fake Irish pub gimmickry, no failing attempts at trendiness, just a bare-bones bar atmosphere and good beer on tap.</bdi>]], [[<b>Congress Plaza Hotel</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">520 S Michigan Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">The Congress Hotel has seen visits from most U.S. presidents since it was built in 1893. Today, other hotels have overtaken the Congress in the glamor class, leaving it behind as a great deal with a colorful past. Ask for a room with a view of the lake \\u2014 if Buckingham Fountain is running, you will be treated to a magnificent view.  The workers of the Congress hotel are currently engaged in the longest hotel strike in history.</bdi>]], [[<b>Hostelling International Chicago</b>, <b>Chicago Architecture Foundation</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">24 E Congress Pkwy</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Right in the middle of the downtown college ruckus, HI Chicago is not far from Union and Ogilvie, but will take some navigating from either airport into Chicago.  Available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  No curfew, no age restrictions (under 18 must be accompanied by adult). Ask for the coupon which gives $3 off the <b>Chicago Architecture Foundation</b> tours.</bdi>]], [[<b>Hard Rock Hotel</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">230 N Michigan Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Near Millennium Park and the <a href=\"/wiki/Chicago/Near_North\" title=\"Chicago/Near North\">Magnificent Mile</a>, with style points for being located in the beautiful Carbon &amp; Carbide Building. Rooms come packed with audiovisual amenities apropos of the name.</bdi>]], [[<b>Hotel 71</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">71 E Wacker Dr</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Located on the Chicago River at Wacker Drive and Michigan Avenue with an impressive view, right on the border of the <a href=\"/wiki/Chicago/Near_North\" title=\"Chicago/Near North\">Near North</a>.</bdi>]], [[<b>Hotel Allegro</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">171 W Randolph St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">This lovely, Art Deco hotel calls itself a boutique, probably in reference to its friendly, full four-star service, designer decorated rooms and prices that are the same, or just a little bit more than you would pay for a blander three-star place just north of the river. Suites and some rooms have a double jacuzzi.</bdi>]], [[<b>Hotel Burnham</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">1 W Washington St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">In the classic Reliance Building, near Millennium Park. A Kimpton Boutique hotel, like the Allegro.</bdi>]], [[<b>Silversmith Hotel &amp; Suites</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">10 S Wabash Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">The Silversmith boasts an enviable location, good value, and perfectly adequate suites, but light sleepers should be sure to ask for a room away from the noisy L lines. Don't miss the dessert hour: free high quality cake, cookies, and coffee/tea in the lobby M-Th 9PM-10PM.</bdi>]], [[<b>W Chicago City Center</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">172 W Adams St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">This outpost of the W Hotels chain is under the shadow of the Sears Tower, in the midst of the Loop, for a bit of stylish gloom at night.</bdi>]], [[<b>The Fairmont Chicago</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">200 N Columbus Dr</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Upscale hotel that takes pride in its restaurants and offers a number of tour packages for Chicago attractions.</bdi>]], [[<b>Hotel Monaco</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">225 N Wabash Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">The Monaco provides a bit better than four-star comfort at a bit less than four-star prices, though they are a little higher than at sister hotels like the Allegro or the Burnham. What you get for the extra money is a number of specialty services geared for business travelers, so if you are traveling for pleasure go for the Allegro.</bdi>]], [[<b>Hyatt Regency Chicago</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">151 E Wacker Dr</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">2,000 guest rooms in two towers, a riverfront location, and what the management claims is the largest freestanding bar in the U.S. It's a favorite for convention groups, and is connected via covered walkways to the Illinois Center, which is a major business complex.</bdi>]], [[<b>Marriott Renaissance Chicago Hotel</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">1 W Wacker Dr</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Elegant hotel with sweeping views and a Rejuvenation Center.</bdi>]], [[<b>The Palmer House</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">17 E Monroe St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">With over 1,600 rooms and no shortage of luxuries, the Palmer House is one of Chicago's most memorable hotels. It was originally built by business magnate Potter Palmer for his socialite wife Bertha. This is actually the third version of the Palmer House \\u2014 the first opened two weeks before the Great Chicago Fire. (Can't beat that for timing.) The current version, overlooking State Street, enjoyed an extravagant renovation in 2008, with tasteful 1920s style guest rooms and a magnificent lobby bar (with magnificently overpriced drinks).</bdi>]], [[<b>Swissotel Chicago</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">323 E Wacker Dr</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">This sleek, new skyscraper offers great views over the Chicago River and the lake.</bdi>]], [[<b>Harold Washington Library Center</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">400 S State St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Chicago\\u2019s central library is in a gigantic, impressive, and stylistically bewildering building, named for Harold Washington, the city's first black Mayor. It holds exhibitions and author events, has an impressive permanent art collection, and is well-equipped with free computer and Internet services.</bdi>]], [[<b>The Arts Club of Chicago</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">201 E Ontario St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Easy to miss, as it's located on a side street without much in the way of signage (or advertising), but this gallery has a long history \\u2014 it opened in 1916, and hosted Pablo Picasso's art show in the U.S. Visitors will find three public art shows each year, usually of exceptional quality. Note the Mies van der Rohe central staircase, which was transplanted from the club's previous Mies-designed location.</bdi>]], [[<b>Bridgehouse &amp; Chicago River Museum</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">376 N Michigan Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Open late spring (mid-May), summer, and fall. A new, small museum spread over the five floors of the southwest tower of the Michigan Avenue Bridge. Visitors can see displays on the history of Chicago's famously abused river, and also check out the machinery used for raising the bridge.</bdi>]], [[<b>The Driehaus Museum</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">40 E Erie St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Adorning the first floor are decorative arts from the collection of the museum's namesake, Richard H. Driehaus, with plenty of Tiffany stained glass. But it's the restored 1883 mansion itself that garners glowing reviews; inside are 17 different types of marble, hand-painted ceilings, carved exotic wood wainscoting and other marks of superior 19th-century craftsmanship. If you're interested in historic architecture and interior design, this is still a hidden gem without crowds. General admission is $20, but there are good senior and student discounts and occasional free programs that include admission.</bdi>]], [[<b>Hancock Observatory</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">John Hancock Center, 875 N Michigan Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">360-degree view from the 94th floor.

(You might recognize them from the cover of <b>Wilco'</b>s <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i>, among many others.) Designed to be \"a city within a city,\" they include a wildly overpriced bowling alley and the <b>House of Blues</b> (see <a href=\"/wiki/Chicago/Near_North#Drink\" title=\"Chicago/Near North\">Drink</a> below).

The MCA has a great location and plenty of financial backing, but it's still fighting for recognition in the museum world; while not an upper-tier institution as yet, that has resulted in some interesting exhibitions. There isn't much of a permanent collection, so check what's on before you go. Also, Wolfgang Puck operates a lunch-only eatery in the MCA.</bdi>]], [[<b>Newberry Library</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">60 W Walton St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">The oldest public library in Chicago, although not part of the city library system.

Occasional author events are held.</bdi>]], [[<b>Tribune Tower</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">435 N Michigan Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Built in 1925, the walls of the Tribune Tower contain rocks from many famous world landmarks, including: the Taj Mahal, the Parthenon, the Great Pyramid, the Cathedral of Notre-Dame, the Great Wall of China, the Berlin Wall, and most recently from the demolished World Trade Center. The Tribune Tower even managed to get its hands on a moon rock, but so far NASA hasn't allowed it to add the rock to the wall.</bdi>]], [[<b>Trump Tower</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">401 N Wabash Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">1362 ft. The Trump Hotel and luxury residential building is both the newest member of the Chicago skyline, completed at the beginning of 2009, and the tallest after the Sears Tower \\u2014 indeed, it is the fourth tallest in the United States. The Donald intended for it to be the tallest in the world, but decided to scale back following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The design features three prominent setbacks at the height of nearby buildings: the Wrigley Building, Marina City, and 330 N Wabash, which, combined with its singularly reflective exterior, allow this supertall to blend into the skyline, almost to the point where you could overlook it. As intended, the building reflects and interacts with the Chicago skyline, rather than imposing itself upon it with its great height. Regardless, you will not likely miss this building, and it's plenty interesting to examine \\u2014 its asymmetric form ensures that you will see something quite different from any different vantage point.</bdi>]], [[<b>Water Tower</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">Chicago Ave &amp; Michigan Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">In 1871, when Mrs. O'Leary's cow kicked over the lantern in her barn \\u2014 or was framed for the act, depending on who you ask \\u2014 the Gothic Revival spires of Water Tower were only two years old. Today, along with the Pumping Station on the other side of the street, the Water Tower is the last, dream-like symbol of the Old Chicago that disappeared in the Fire. Surrounded by hotels and colossal department stores, it's also <i>the</i> icon of the new city that arose. At night, the Water Tower is lit from within, and it's a memorable sight. Inside, the vintage machinery is long gone (along with the water), and the plain interior is occasionally used as a gallery space.</bdi>]], [[<b>Andrew Bae Gallery</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">300 W Superior</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Specializes in contemporary Asian art, particularly Korean and Japanese.</bdi>]], [[<b>Catherine Edelman Gallery</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">300 W Superior St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Contemporary photography and mixed-media.</bdi>]], [[<b>Ken Saunders Gallery</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">230 W Superior St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Contemporary glass sculptures.</bdi>]], [[<b>Maya Polsky Gallery</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">215 W Superior St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Consistently one of the most intriguing galleries in the area, with playful, well-displayed paintings and sculpture both local and from Russia.</bdi>]], [[<b>Melanee Cooper Gallery</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">740 N Franklin St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Fascinating contemporary art, mostly abstract and representational.</bdi>]], [[<b>Richard Gray Gallery</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">875 N Michigan Ave, Suite 2503 (Hancock Center)</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Big and very big names from modern and contemporary American and European art, including <a href=\"/wiki/Chicago/Loop#See\" title=\"Chicago/Loop\">Millennium Park</a> sculptor Jaume Plensa.</bdi>]], [[<b>Stephen Daiter Gallery</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">311 W Superior St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Artistic and documentary photography from America and Europe.</bdi>]], [[<b>Valerie Carberry Gallery</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">875 N Michigan Ave, Suite 2510 (Hancock Center)</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Pre and post-war American art, particularly 1930-1949.</bdi>]], [[<b>Navy Pier</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">600 E Grand Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Built in 1916, Navy Pier has had many different uses over the years; in 1994, it became a tourist attraction, with more than 50 acres of restaurants, shops, and activities by Lake Michigan.

The original Soldier Field was built in 1924 to honor veterans of the First World War, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. By 2002, the stadium was in dire need of renovations, and the Bears promised to preserve the majestic colonnades of the old stadium. However, when the renovations were complete, what appeared to be a giant spaceship had landed at midfield. The amenities have improved, and it really is a nice facility... on the inside. On the outside, it's hard to say <i>what</i> it is, other than probably the strangest-looking sports venue in America.

The separate revues on the <b>Mainstage</b> and the <b>e.t.c.</b> theaters are consistently smart, timely, and funny. (The third stage, Donny's Skybox, is rented out to local sketch troupes outside the artistic direction of Second City, and is hit-or-miss.) The third act of the night is fully improvised, and if there's space left among the paying customers from the first two acts, admission is free.</bdi>]], [[<b>Steppenwolf</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">1650 N Halsted St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">The creation of John Malkovich, Gary Sinise, and many others, Steppenwolf features cutting-edge theater and doesn't trade on the famous name, offering both original material and incisive re-stagings of classic plays (like a terrific recent production of <i>The Crucible</i>).

But there's also food and good live music (local high school and national performers), garden walks through the historic district and the neighborhood at its early summer best.</bdi>]], [[<b>Apollo Theater</b>, <b><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://babywantscandy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Baby Wants Candy</a></b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2540 N Lincoln Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">An eclectic mix on two stages includes solo shows, major contemporary plays like \"Ragtime\" and \"The Vagina Monologues,\" and the popular improvised musicals of <b><a class=\"external text\" href=\"http://babywantscandy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Baby Wants Candy</a></b> (Sa 10:30PM, $15).</bdi>]], [[<b>Lincoln Hall</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2424 N Lincoln Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Once of the best concert venues in Chicago, this former movie theater received a beautiful renovation in 2009 and now hosts good, moderately priced ($12-15) indie rock shows most nights of the week. (Keep an eye out for some excellent free events on Sundays.) Arrive early for a space in the roomy balcony or a few drinks in the comfortable bar area. There's a Dillinger connection here, too \\u2014 the FBI's sharpshooters were camped out on the theater's roof, waiting for him to leave the Biograph.</bdi>]], [[<b>Park West</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">322 W Armitage Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">This converted movie theater (and former burlesque hall) has some of the best acoustics in the U.S., and it's surprisingly intimate considering it can seat up to a thousand. None other than Ringo Starr has said that Park West is second only to <a href=\"/wiki/London\" title=\"London\">London</a>'s Royal Albert Hall. Fans will crowd the stage, but the best seats are toward the back, near the main bar and in the balconies... or call in advance to reserve a booth.</bdi>]], [[<b>Remy Bumppo Theater Company</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">Greenhouse Theater Center: 2257 N Lincoln Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">For the past decade, Remy Bumppo Theatre Company's passion for the power of great theatrical language has enriched Chicago's world-class theatre scene. Masterful acting and directing by the company's ensemble of professional artists showcases the wit and wisdom of the world's great playwrights. A hallmark of Remy Bumppo's work is the intimacy of its 150-seat theater, which puts you close to the actors, sweeping you into each play's exhilarating mix of passionate storytelling and invigorating ideas. And the best part is, after the curtain call ends and the houselights go up, you sense the whirring of brain cells around you. The play lives on as the conversation begins.</bdi>]], [[<b>Royal George Theater</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">1641 N Halsted St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Home to the <i>long</i>-running <i>Late Night Catechism</i> and its variations, the Royal George has a couple of stages for \"cheeky\" parodies and satires that go down nice with moderately wealthy white folks.</bdi>]], [[<b>Second City</b>, <b>Mainstage</b>, <b>e.t.c.</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">1616 N Wells St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">The list of Second City alumni in show business has become something of a cliche \\u2014 Alan Alda, John Belushi, Bill Murray, on and on \\u2014 and it's still going strong today, with recent graduates like Stephen Colbert, Steve Carell, and Tina Fey. The separate revues on the <b>Mainstage</b> and the <b>e.t.c.</b> theaters are consistently smart, timely, and funny. (The third stage, Donny's Skybox, is rented out to local sketch troupes outside the artistic direction of Second City, and is hit-or-miss.) The third act of the night is fully improvised, and if there's space left among the paying customers from the first two acts, admission is free.</bdi>]], [[<b>Steppenwolf</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">1650 N Halsted St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">The creation of John Malkovich, Gary Sinise, and many others, Steppenwolf features cutting-edge theater and doesn't trade on the famous name, offering both original material and incisive re-stagings of classic plays (like a terrific recent production of <i>The Crucible</i>). Unlike Second City, the famous alumni of Steppenwolf make occasional returns to the stage as their schedules allow.</bdi>]], [[<b>Victory Gardens</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2433 N Lincoln Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">One of the premier Off-Loop theaters in Chicago, Victory Gardens hosts a noteworthy slate of original plays and adaptations both fun and dramatic. Among their several stages is the Biograph Theater, and they're kind enough to screen classic movies there ($5) from time to time so people can relive old Hollywood and ill-fated dates of John Dillinger.</bdi>]], [[<b>Zanies Comedy Nite Club</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">1548 N Wells St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">This is Chicago's flagship stand-up comedy club and hosts all the big international stand-up touring acts. Each show hosts two openers, a great chance to see some future stars as some of the Second City folk develop their voice. It is a must see place for Chicago Comedy.</bdi>]], [[<b>Fleet Feet Sports</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">210 W North Ave, Piper's Alley</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Reinforce tired feet and outdoor gear here.

Right here to bring you.</bdi>]], [[<b>Branko's</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">1118 W Fullerton Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">This mom-and-pop establishment has been whipping up sandwiches for DePaul students since 1976, and the service alone is worth the trip. Fries are free with almost everything on the menu and a Jumbo Chicago style dog with fries and a large drink comes to about 5 bucks. Cash only.</bdi>]], [[<b>Clarke's</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2441 N Lincoln Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Breakfast all day and night, although burgers are available, too. The food is decent at best, but the hours make it a must-know for anyone on the Lincoln Park bar scene.</bdi>]], [[<b>CityGrounds</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">507 W Dickens Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">CityGrounds coffee bar serves artisan coffee, loose leaf tea and locally produced pastries, cakes and breads.

The prices are absurdly low for the amount of satisfaction you'll get from the Mediterranean salad bar or falafel sandwiches here. They also do a fine <i>shawerma</i>.</bdi>]], [[<b>Vienna Beef Factory</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2501 N Damen Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Hoo boy, it's the motherlode. This is where all Chicago's hot dogs are born (not to mention Polish sausages, Italian Beef, and other assorted deli meats). You cannot eat a truer Chicago hot dog than in the factory itself, and the prices are among the best in the city. Parking is easy in the outside lot.</bdi>]], [[<b>The Wiener's Circle</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2622 N Clark St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">The food is only so-so, the prices fair, but what makes this walk-up joint famous is the staff, who have zero patience for customers and the colorful language skills of a bartender at the seediest dockside bar imaginable. A favorite of the late-night crowd, who after a long night of drinking seem to find major entertainment value in being served a massive dose of profane invective with their greasy chili fries and Chicago-style hot dogs.</bdi>]], [[<b>Bacino's Pizzeria</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2204 N Lincoln Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A Lincoln Park branch of the Loop favorite that serves what many call the city's best <a href=\"/wiki/Chicago#Chicago_pizza\" title=\"Chicago\">stuffed pizza</a>.</bdi>]], [[<b>Bistrot Margot</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">1437 N Wells St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Casual French bistro at reasonable prices, with an enthusiastic chef and charming decor.

Don't put much stock in their claim regarding the best margaritas in the world (1/2 price Tu&amp;Th), but their <i>mole</i> sauce and their fried ice cream <i>are</i> worth bragging about.</bdi>]], [[<b>Pequod's</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2207 N Clybourn Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Great place to get caramelized/burnt crust Chicago style deep dish pizza, considered a secret favorite.</bdi>]], [[<b>Raj Darbar</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2660 N Halsted St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Great Indian food with an extensive menu. The service is creaky and the staff always seem to be breaking in flocks of new busboys, but the taste and decor are worth the stop.</bdi>]], [[<b>Tandoor Char House</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2652 N Halsted St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Indian/Pakistani cuisine, good bite before the B.L.U.E.S. or the Kingston Mines.</bdi>]], [[<b>Twin Anchors</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">1655 N Sedgwick St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Impress your friends with your knowledge of Chicago by \"stumbling across\" this hidden neighborhood joint.

Reservations can be tough to get; start well in advance with the ticket system on their website and keep an eye on their social media for same-night tables.</bdi>]], [[<b>Boka</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">1729 N Halsted St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">The menu mixes Japanese, Mediterranean, European, and dang ol' Midwestern food without apparent self-consciousness. Plenty of seafood and a raw bar, too. Dinners are satisfying but light, making it the perfect place for a pre-show meal. You won't need formal dress, but you will need a reservation.</bdi>]], [[<b>3rd Coast Cafe</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">1260 N Dearborn St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Once known as the Chicago meet-up spot for 2600, the computer hackers quarterly, 3rd Coast is an upscale late-night oasis amid blocks of impressive, silent Old Town row houses. Evenings feature jazz and solo guitarists, and the food is far above average for a cafe.</bdi>]], [[<b>B.L.U.E.S.</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2519 N Halsted St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Small but dedicated blues bar. On Sundays, one cover charge gets you into B.L.U.E.S. and Kingston Mines across the road. This is one of the true Chicago blues experiences.</bdi>]], [[<b>Delilah's</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2770 N Lincoln Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">This is the joint where Kurt (Cobain) met Courtney (Love). No kidding. The booze selection is unbeatable and recent almost-rock-stars spin the records.</bdi>]], [[<b>Kingston Mines</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2548 N Halsted St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">The larger of the blues bars on Halsted.

The round wood track-lit dance floor is a stand-out, too. If your friends don't dance, they can wait at the bar upstairs.</bdi>]], [[<b>Neo</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2350 N Clark St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A Goth dance fortress in the heart of Lincoln Park. Music varies by night, mostly industrial and electro, with metal on Mondays and '80s/new wave on Thursdays.

Two blocks west of the train station.</bdi>]], [[<b>4944 S Woodlawn</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">4944 S Woodlawn Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A gargantuan 8,000 square foot Tudor revival mansion once owned by Muhammad Ali.</bdi>]], [[<b>Drexel Fountain</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">at Hyde Park Blvd &amp; Drexel Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">This ornate fountain that stands in the tiny Drexel Square Park is the oldest in Chicago \\u2014 one of the first monuments erected in the Chicago area. Commissioned by a wealthy stockbroker by the name of Francis Drexel, who managed to get the avenue, square, and fountain all named after himself without ever setting foot in Chicago.</bdi>]], [[<b>Elijah Muhammad House</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">4855 S Woodlawn Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Built by Elijah Muhammad, the founder of the Nation of Islam, it now serves as a 'National' House for the Nation of Islam. Designed by an Egyptian Architect, Dr. Mostafa Momen of Momen Architects &amp; Consulting Engineers, it shares the same features of the four houses he designed for Elijah Muhammad's family located to the north, directly across the street.</bdi>]], [[<b>Isidore Heller House</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">5132 S Woodlawn</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">One of Frank Lloyd Wright's earliest distinctive buildings (1897), often credited as the turning point in his early career when he shifted towards the Prairie School.</bdi>]], [[<b>KAMII</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">5039 S Greenwood Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">It looks like a Byzantine style mosque, but that minaret is actually a smokestack for this synagogue. The building was built in 1924 for the reform Isaiah Israel congregation, which later merged with Chicago's oldest Jewish congregation, Kehilath Anshe Ma'ariv (KAM), which in turn moved out of its massive temple on Drexel Avenue. The interior is marvelously elaborate. There are stained-glass depictions of humans, which is very unusual for a synagogue, and the walls appears to be made out of ancient stone -- but they're actually just plaster!</bdi>]], [[<b>Masjid Al-Faatir</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">1200 E 47th St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Masjid Al-Faatir is the largest of Chicago's Mosques. Founded by Boxing World Heavyweight Champion Muhammad Ali and his manager Jabir Herbert Muhammad (son of Elijah Muhammad) in 1987. It was later renovated with the help of the Late President of the UAE, Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahayan.</bdi>]], [[<b>McGill Mansion</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">4938 S Drexel Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Easily mistaken for a French Castle, this mansion was built in 1893 for the Scottish McGill family, which founded the famous <a href=\"/wiki/Montreal\" title=\"Montreal\">Montreal</a> University of the same name. The mansion was converted into 34 condos in 2000.</bdi>]], [[<b>Operation Push HQ</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">930 E 50th St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">The enormous classical revival building at 50th &amp; Drexel is the national headquarters of the Reverend Jesse Jackson's Rainbow PUSH organization. The building's fa\\xe7ade might lead you to expect a Lincoln-sized statue of the reverend inside, but this was actually a Jewish synagogue founded in 1932 by the aforementioned KAM.</bdi>]], [[<b>The Obama House</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">5046 Greenwood Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">This beautiful house is home to the family of former U.S. President Barack Obama. The vacant lot to the left was the source of minor controversy in Chicago, when it came out that the Obama family had purchased it at sub-market rates from friend and criminal real estate broker Tony Rezko. You'll notice, despite the much touted media characterizations of their house as a \"Hyde Park white-porticoed mansion,\" it's not actually in Hyde Park, and while a nice big house, it's no mansion. Good luck getting on the 5000 block of Greenwood \\u2014 it's still the family house, and the block is closed off even to pedestrians, and crawling with police and Secret Service. You should be able to get a look up from the 51st St sidewalk, but lingering around taking photographs might draw unwelcome attention from security.</bdi>]], [[<b>Main Campus</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">5801 S Ellis Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">One of the world's great universities, the University of Chicago's Gothic campus exudes academic rigor and intellectual intensity, known to students as \"the place where fun goes to die.\" Its imposing gray buildings make it a must-see for architecture fans. Even if you are not a prospective student, you can take advantage of its free campus tours.</bdi>]], [[<b>Smart Museum of Art</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">5550 S Greenwood Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">The Smart museum is small, but has an excellent collection, thoughtfully exhibited. Staff is very friendly.</bdi>]], [[<b>Regenstein Library</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">1100 E 57th St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">If you are not a student and are not on a tour, you can't enter the gigantic collection of over 4.5 million volumes, but you can marvel at the exterior architecture. The building is one of the world's best examples of the Brutalist movement, which emphasized the structural materials (rough concrete in this case), as well as striking repetitions and irregularities of angular forms.</bdi>]], [[<b>Nuclear Energy Statue</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">5700 S Ellis Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">This Henry Moore statue marks the area where Enrico Fermi and his team of scientists successfully produced the first controlled nuclear chain reaction. Although possibly unintended, visitors often see a resemblance to a human skull or mushroom cloud.</bdi>]], [[<b>Oriental Institute Museum</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">1155 E 58th St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">The University of Chicago Oriental Institute has one of the best collections of ancient Egyptian and Near Eastern archeology in the world, which is moreover free, small, very well exhibited, and basically started by Indiana Jones. Some highlights include: much of the Assyrian \"Fortress of Sargon,\" a colossal statue of King Tutankhamun, and the Mummy and Coffin of Meresamun. Visitors with a strong interest may want to devote several hours to pore over the dense exhibits, but the small museum can be quickly \"skimmed\" in 15 minutes.</bdi>]], [[<b>The Renaissance Society</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">5811 S Ellis Ave, Cobb Hall 418</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A small non-collecting contemporary art gallery that is over 100 years old and very highly respected. It will appeal greatly to art aficionados, less so to casual visitors.</bdi>]], [[<b>Rockefeller Memorial Chapel</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">5850 S Woodlawn Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">This giant Gothic church is named for the University founder, John D. Rockefeller, who intended it to be the \"central and dominant feature\" of the University. It may not be that, but it is impressive, with a huge organ and the second largest carillon in the world. A great way to view the chapel and experience its acoustics is by showing up for one of the Wednesday lunchtime organ concerts.</bdi>]], [[<b>Hyde Park Art Center</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">5020 S Cornell Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">The oldest alternative art venue in the city is dedicated to the visual arts, usually has several contemporary exhibits running at any given time, and frequent events like artist talks, poetry readings, and music performances.</bdi>]], [[<b>Jackson Park</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">6401 S Stony Island Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Named for President Andrew Jackson and the site of the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893. The most prominent monument remaining from the event is the fully gilded \"Statue of the Republic.\" Other sites include the Osaka Garden on the Wooded Island, a series of lagoons designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, and several well-hidden bird watching trails along the water.</bdi>]], [[<b>Osaka Garden</b>], [], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">The Osaka Garden grew out of the Pavilion for the Japanese Government at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition and was planned by Olmsted as well. During WWII, the gardens suffered from repeated anti-Japanese vandalism and arson, culminating in the site's abandonment to those unsavory types who inhabit abandoned urban parkland. Chicago's sister city, <a href=\"/wiki/Osaka\" title=\"Osaka\">Osaka</a>, donated the money in the 1980s to restore the gardens, prompting a name change from the Japanese Garden to the Osaka Garden. Today, the gardens are one of Chicago's finest secret places and a wonderful escape from harrowing tourist adventures.</bdi>]], [[<b>Midway Park</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">1130 Midway Plaisance N</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A large, long grassy park, intended for the World's Fair, with grandiose plans of arched bridges over a canal connecting the lagoons of Washington and Jackson Parks, but which today mostly serves to give visitors a good view of the University of Chicago. The Winter/Summer reading gardens just south of the University's main quad are quite beautiful and a nice place to relax from touring. Also during the winter there is free ice skating.</bdi>]], [[<b>Museum of Science and Industry</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">5700 S Lake Shore Dr &amp; E 57th St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">No tour of Chicago's museums is complete without a visit to this one. Spend hours upon hours looking at really cool stuff you never even knew you didn't know about. So much to do, so little time. You can return for free the following day if you take your ticket to \"Will Call\" on the way out on your first day. Great for kids, with many hands-on exhibits and the famous Coal Mine; adults will enjoy the display of the German U-boat 'U-505'. The immense, beautiful building was itself built as part of the White City in 1893, and is the last of the grand buildings left in Hyde Park.</bdi>]], [[<b>Robie House</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">5757 S Woodlawn Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">This fabulously impractical house designed by Frank Lloyd Wright is one of the world's most famous examples of the Midwestern \"Prairie School\" of architecture, which aimed to create buildings with prominent horizontal lines evocative of the prairie landscape. The interior is bizarre, intended to remind its inhabitants of a ship, and is surrounded by stained art glass windows. You must take an official tour to see the interior, which lasts about an hour. Tours of the surrounding historic neighborhood are offered as well \\u2014 it is best to make reservations online beforehand. Be sure to take a gander at the University of Chicago's Business School across the street, which was designed to emulate the style of the Robie House in a more modern fashion.</bdi>]], [[<b>Court Theatre</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">5535 S Ellis Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Excellent dramatic theater on the University campus.</bdi>]], [[<b>Doc Films</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">1212 E 59th St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Those zoning laws are again to \"blame\" for the total absence of any movie theaters in this section of Chicago. But their absence clearly benefits the longest-running student film society in the country, which puts on an impressive number of independent documentaries, art-house films, and other socially relevant movies throughout the year, all in a state-of-the-art cinema. Doc Films attracts a very knowledgeable crowd (perhaps because the students and neighborhood residents have no other movie options!) and it is a good place to eavesdrop on some intense, intellectual conversations.</bdi>]], [[<b>Jackson Park Golf Course</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">6300 S Hayes Dr</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">18 holes of golf and a driving range, all in the middle of Jackson Park.

Also serves excellent floats with flavors like almond and grenadine. If you ask the admissions office to recommend a nice place nearby to take your kid, they'll point you in this direction.</bdi>]], [[<b>Pizza Capri</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">1501 E 53rd St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Good upscale Italian cuisine and stuffed pizza at a reliable Chicagoland chain.

Its got a weird 70's nautical theme, interesting music on the jukebox, and cheap drinks. Unfortunately, it's also a tiny space and can get overcrowded.</bdi>]], [[<b>Falcon Inn</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">1601 E 53rd St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">The sleeper dive bar in Hyde Park, largely unknown to the student crowd. It's tucked away on a quiet section of 53rd Street, and serves an eclectic crowd of friendly locals, who come to relax, enjoy the very cheap beer, and the pizza through the window to Cholie's next door.

A good place to be served beer by PhDs and to listen in on the intense intellectual debates about topics you didn't know existed. Some famous writers used to frequent the bar, including Saul Bellow and Dylan Thomas. Live jazz on Sunday nights and you might catch a University improv comedy group during the week. But above all, the dark cavernous atmosphere, the low-key vibe, and the greasy burgers make this one of the best dives in the city. While it's a university favorite, <i>don't</i> expect a rowdy singles scene here \\u2014 it's the U of C, folks.</bdi>]], [[<b>Hyatt Place Chicago-South/University Medical Center</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">5225 S Harper Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Hyatt Place Chicago-South/University Medical Center is a new hotel (opened in September 2013) that is located in the heart of Hyde Park's new Harper Court development.

Harold's was born right near here on 47th street, by the way, in north <a href=\"/wiki/Chicago/Hyde_Park\" title=\"Chicago/Hyde Park\">Kenwood</a>, although the original location (at Greenwood) closed long ago.</bdi>]], [[<b>#40</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">307 E 55th St</bdi>], []], [[<b>#7</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">108 E 47th St</bdi>], []], [[<b>Chicago's Home of Chicken &amp; Waffles</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">3947 S Martin Luther King Jr Dr</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A great little place serving all sorts of different combinations of, as you might expect, chicken and waffles, as well as your standard soul food menu, expertly executed. The neighborhood is underserved by such nice establishments, though, and given the small space that means there's a significant wait to be seated virtually any time of the week. Oh, and the extra \"s\" in Rosscoe's is to forestall lawsuits from the <a href=\"/wiki/Los_Angeles\" title=\"Los Angeles\">L.A.</a> chain. The pretty building the place inhabits was a hotel back in the days when blacks could not stay at \"white hotels\" around the city, so this one played host to some big African-American celebrities, including local Muhammad Ali.</bdi>]], [[<b>Ms Biscuit</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">5431 S Wabash Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A great soul food breakfast spot, where the biscuits can't be missed and the pancakes are delicious. It's in a dicey area, but you should have no trouble parking right in front, and the place itself is friendly, bright, and cheery. And the food is really heads and shoulders above the competition throughout much of the South Side.</bdi>]], [[<b>Pearl's Place</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">3901 S Michigan Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A nice sit down soul food eatery right in the heart of Bronzeville and adorned with pictures of famous historical Bronzeville residents (and adjacent to the Amber Inn). Brunch/breakfast is where they really shine, with famous sausage, Belgian waffles, and of course sweet potato pie. Very friendly staff.</bdi>]], [[<b>Jokes and Notes</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">4641 S Martin Luther King Jr Dr</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A small and cozy comedy/smooth jazz club primarily featuring African-American stand-up comedians.</bdi>]], [[<b>Room 43</b>, <b>Sunday Jazz</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">1043 E 43rd St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">The Hyde Park Jazz Society's <b>Sunday Jazz</b> has moved north out of Hyde Park to a little known bar/venue, which is a small, more intimate space.

One of the few nice places to stay in the area. Much cheaper and infinitely less pretentious than the big hotels downtown, with a fine, southern Sunday brunch. Just off I-90.</bdi>]], [[<b>South Loop Hotel</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">11 W 26th St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A really nice, brand new mid-range hotel located right on the border of the <a href=\"/wiki/Chicago/Near_South\" title=\"Chicago/Near South\">Near South</a>, quite close to downtown. It's most convenient to <a href=\"/wiki/Chicago/Bridgeport-Chinatown\" title=\"Chicago/Bridgeport-Chinatown\">Chinatown</a>, as well as the Cermak-Chinatown L station, two blocks away. Gym, business center, free parking (!), sports bar, and an on-site restaurant.</bdi>]], [[<b>Welcome Manor Inn</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">4563 S Michigan Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Located in an old, rehabbed, 7,000 square foot Victorian mansion, this is a very nice luxury option at a great value for anyone interested in staying in Bronzeville. In fact, this B&amp;B is probably alone reason enough to come to Bronzeville, as it is one of America's few black-owned inns. The five really beautiful rooms/suites, with optional fireplaces and jacuzzis, are dedicated to important figures from African-American history, and the owners take pride in setting up tours and helping guests explore the neighborhood. Without a doubt, this is <i>the</i> place to stay in Bronzeville, even if its location is a little off the beaten path. If you have a car, it's also just a great value for the city, as they have both garage parking and unrestricted and easily available on-street parking, making it really convenient to Bridgeport, Hyde Park, and the Loop. Breakfast served daily and available to walk-ins by reservation.</bdi>]], [[<b>Chicago Bee Library</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">3647-3655 S State St</bdi>], []], [[<b>Hall Library</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">4801 S Michigan Ave</bdi>], []], [[<b>Chinatown Square</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2100 S Wentworth Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">This main square is a Chinatown landmark, with some pagoda-like structures as well as animal sculptures of the Chinese zodiac. Be sure to check out the Chinatown Mural \\u2014 a mosaic of painted tiles depicting the migration of Chinese-Americans from China to, ultimately, Chicago's Chinatown. Ultimately, though, the reason to come here is to wander into the surrounding Chinatown Marketplace, full of narrow alleys packed with shops and restaurants, which occasionally threaten to transport you back to <a href=\"/wiki/Taipei\" title=\"Taipei\">Taipei</a>.</bdi>]], [[<b>Chinese-American Museum of Chicago</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">238 W 23rd St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A museum with exhibits on Chinese-American culture, history, and the community's contributions to American society. Long closed due to a fire, the museum has finally reopened 25 September 2010.</bdi>]], [[<b>Chinese American Veterans Memorial</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2169 S Archer Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A small memorial to Chicago Chinatown residents who served the United States in foreign wars.</bdi>]], [[<b>Dr Sun Yat Sen Museum</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2245 S Wentworth Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A one-room museum good for some Kuomintang nostalgia.</bdi>]], [[<b>Nine Dragon Wall</b>], [], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A smaller semblance of the ancient glazed tile Nine Dragon Wall located in <a href=\"/wiki/Beijing\" title=\"Beijing\">Beijing</a>'s Behai Park.</bdi>]], [[<b>Ping Tom Memorial Park</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">300 W 19th St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A riverside park with a Chinese touch, including a riverside Chinese pavilion and a bamboo garden.

A very interesting place to browse!</bdi>]], [[<b>Daley Residence</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">3536 S Lowe Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Life-long home of the famous, the infamous, Richard J.

There isn't much at all to be seen here aside from the nice prairie-style brick one story, and don't bother the current residents.</bdi>]], [[<b>Saint Barbara Church</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2859 S Throop St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Built in 1914 to house overflow from Saint Mary of Perpetual Help, in the so-called \"Polish Cathedral Style.\" Dominates the Bridgeport skyline along with St Mary's.</bdi>]], [[<b>Saint Mary of Perpetual Help</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">1039 W 32nd St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Another massive, opulent church of the Polish Cathedral Style, built in 1882.</bdi>]], [[<b>Zhou B Art Center</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">1029 W 35th St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A big arts center in the heart of Bridgeport hosting three contemporary painting galleries: Oskar Friedl, 33 Collective, and the Zhou Brothers Art Foundation, as well as the eerie abstracts and mixed-media experiments of 4Art. The Oskar Friedl Gallery in particular really warrants a visit as it is one of the city's better spots for avant-garde works. Check ahead to make sure the gallery that interests you is open. The whole huge place is open to wander around on the 3rd Friday of each month.</bdi>]], [[<b>Armour Square Park</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">3309 S Shields Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A good place to play some baseball, soccer, volleyball, basketball, or take a dip in the pool. Occasional events include outdoor movie screenings.</bdi>]], [[<b>Chicago Chinese Cultural Institute</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2145 S China Pl, 2F</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Offers an assortment of services and events, such as: neighborhood tours, film screenings, language instruction, and cooking classes.</bdi>]], [[<b>Chinatown Summer Fair</b>], [], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A fun neighborhood festival, with a Lion Dance procession along Wentworth at 12:30PM, and performances starting at 1PM, 23rd &amp; Wentworth.</bdi>]], [[<b>Dragon Boat Race</b>], [], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Dragon Boats along the South Branch of the Chicago River.</bdi>]], [[<b>Sun Yat Sen Park</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">251 West 24th Pl</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A little out of the way, but a nice small park and a great place to relax in the shade on a hot summer day.</bdi>]], [[<b>Guaranteed Rate Field</b>], [], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Formerly known as New Comiskey Park and later as U.S. Cellular Field, this is the home of the White Sox. The stadium itself was a notorious dud when it opened in 1991, but recent renovations have helped tremendously. If you just want to see a Chicago ball game and don't care who is playing, the stately charm of Wrigley Field might be the better option. But Sox tickets are easier to get, the fans are no less loyal, and the fireworks shows after Saturday night home games (win or lose) are worth the price of admission by themselves. For a nifty ballpark treat not offered at Wrigley, try the <i>elotes</i>, corn-off-the-cob with your choice of salt, butter, cheese, lime, and/or red pepper.</bdi>]], [[<b>Chinatown Bazaar</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2221 S Wentworth Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">An odd gift shop with just about anything you could expect to be at a \"Chinatown bazaar.\" It has a particularly good collection of cloth posters.</bdi>]], [[<b>C W Mei's Gift &amp; Jewelry Co.</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2241 S Wentworth Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Kung fu outfitters: swords, knives, outfits.</bdi>]], [[<b>Evergreen Jewelry</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2263 S Wentworth Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Just what the name would suggest, the store sells jewelry.</bdi>]], [[<b>Golden Dragon Fortune Cookies</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2323 S Archer Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Yes, the man who writes the fortunes is in this factory. Buy fortune cookies fresh out of the oven, or get them in bulk until you can't carry any more.</bdi>]], [[<b>Hoypoloi Gallery</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2235 S Wentworth Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Probably Chicago's strangest upscale boutique with all sorts of interesting artwork and furnishings for interior decorators and gift shoppers.</bdi>]], [[<b>Ten Ren Tea and Ginseng Co of Chicago Ltd</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2247 S Wentworth Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Wide selection of teas and tea accessories in a store for serious tea drinkers (if you use bags, that doesn't include you). Worth a visit just for the free samples!</bdi>]], [[<b>K POP of Chinatown</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2223 S Wentworth  Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Store that specializes in all kinds of K-Pop (Korean pop) music and merchandise with CD's, DVD's, shirts, mugs, posters and other types of merchandise. Lots of unique and interesting K-Pop stuff sold here.</bdi>]], [[<b>Augustine's Eternal Gifts</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">3327 S Halsted St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A store full of everything spiritual: from a rosary and cross collection to occult tomes and voodoo powders. Knowledgeable and helpful staff. They occasionally offer classes in mysticism (call for current information).</bdi>]], [[<b>Grandstand</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">600 W 35th St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A store with extensive inventory of sports memorabilia. A good place to pick up a reproduction Negro League jersey or rare baseball cards.</bdi>]], [[<b>Let's Boogie</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">3321 S Halsted St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A big vinyl store specializing in dance music from house to hip hop. No used records around, only new. A popular shop with Chicago DJs.</bdi>]], [[<b>Feida Bakery</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2228 S Wentworth Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A small, reliable bakery, where the baked goods can warm your stomach for less than a dollar. Dim sum is not as good as you can get elsewhere, but it is dirt cheap. Items vary in quality, but the seafood dumplings and desserts are excellent.</bdi>]], [[<b>Lawrence's Fisheries</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2120 S Canal St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">It's amazing that this place exists so close to downtown. It's fried fish heaven with frogs legs, $1.45 clam strips, fried oysters, scallops, and boiled shrimp. All that with views of the skyline, intriguing industrial and river bridge panoramas, and of a good sized hanging shark.</bdi>]], [[<b>The Noodle Vietnamese Cuisine</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2336 S Wentworth Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A solid Vietnamese pho (noodle soup with beef) joint, which qualifies as \"ethnic food\" for Chinatown residents \\u2014 this is one of the few places around where you'll likely see only Chinatown residents, even on weekends.</bdi>]], [[<b>Saint's Alp Teahouse</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2131 S Archer Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A Hong Kong teahouse chain with a very long beverage list also serves entrees. <i>Young</i> crowd that enjoys the all-ages hangout.</bdi>]], [[<b>Seven Treasures</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2312 S Wentworth Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Seven Treasures has a huge, if uninteresting, interior and late hours, but the reason to come here is for Cantonese noodle soup. Anyone who has spent time in China, and hankers for the noodle soup they had there will not be disappointed. The Hong Kong-style barbecue menu is worthwhile.</bdi>]], [[<b>Kevin's Hamburger Heaven</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">554 W Pershing Rd</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Chicago, for all that it takes fast food so seriously, tends to fail in the hamburger category. <i>Not here</i>. Kevin's serves what is likely the best down-to-earth hamburger in the city, as well as classic malts, shakes, and floats. As far as atmosphere goes, think industrial wasteland truck stop with patrons and workers who may have done time.</bdi>]], [[<b>Maxwell St Depot</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">411 W 31st St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Insomniacs take note! Chicago fare is the whole menu: Maxwell Street Polishes, pork chop sandwiches, hot dogs, and hamburgers. This spot serves what might be the world's <i>fastest</i> food \\u2014 served usually before you can complete your order \\u2014 but it's magically piping hot fresh of the grill. The crowd can get pretty weird around F Sa 4AM, and the ingredients are of low quality, but the meats are cooked perfectly; and especially at that hour (after drinks) few things are more satisfying than a hot off the grill pork chop sandwich with a heaped mass of grilled onions and mustard.</bdi>]], [[<b>Morrie O'Malley's Hot Dogs</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">3501 S Union Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Since U.S. Cellular Field can't seem to do them right, get your <a href=\"/wiki/Chicago#The_Chicago_hot_dog\" title=\"Chicago\">real Chicago hot dogs</a> here. Also, if you want any good insider information about the neighborhood, ask Morrie \\u2014 he's helpful, friendly, and knows the area as well as anybody. If Morrie's is closed and you need a hot dog, you can get a fine one up at 35th Red Hots, closer to the stadium.</bdi>]], [[<b>Ricobene's</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">250 W 26th St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">With one exception the food here is uninspired, but the atmosphere is extreme Bridgeport, and it's a great place to bring kids. The exception is the Italian breaded steak sandwich, yet another neighborhood \"delicacy,\" which it does better than anyone. There's nothing subtle about it \\u2014 a big ol' breaded steak on chewy Italian bread, optionally drenched in red sauce, plus cheese, and hot or sweet giardinera. Don't order the king size unless you like to view your meal as a challenge.</bdi>]], [[<b>Scoops</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">608 W 31st St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A deceptively old fashioned neighborhood ice cream parlor offering homemade ice cream in a non-old fashioned variety of flavors. They also happen to have free WiFi and homemade cannoli.</bdi>]], [[<b>Bertucci's Corner</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">300 W 24th St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">This family-run Italian joint exudes so much Chicago character, you will feel like you just stepped off the Chinatown street into a 1930s gangster movie. Scruffy, no-nonsense Italian-American food. The fact that it's in Chinatown only attests to its hidden gem status. Full bar.</bdi>]], [[<b>Cantonesia</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">204 W Cermak Rd</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">An 60-year-old establishment offering serving adequate Cantonese cuisine and much trumpeted Mai Tais. Stick to the noodle dishes and the hot and sour soup.</bdi>]], [[<b>Ken-Kee Restaurant</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2129 S China Pl</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">One of the best bets in the Chinatown Marketplace with an extraordinarily long menu offering Cantonese preparations of virtually any creature or vegetable. It's hard to get a table on weekend nights.</bdi>]], [[<b>Mandarin Kitchen</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2143 S Archer St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">As the name might lead you to expect, Mandarin Kitchen is one of the few restaurants around serving northern Chinese cuisine, which is generally drier and heartier than the other cuisines you can sample in Chinatown. Hot pots, where you cook the meat on your table, are the house specialty, and great for groups. Otherwise the lamb cumin and noodle dishes are very good bets.</bdi>]], [[<b><i>Little</i> Three Happiness</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">209 W Cermak Rd</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">There are two \"Three Happinesses\" right across the street from each other, and as you might guess, the small dingy looking one on the south side of the street is far superior. LTH is so beloved, the city's most knowledgeable foodie website is <i>named after it</i>. Specialties are many, including pan-fried rice noodles, spare ribs, crispy duck and chicken, and most famously the heads-on salt and pepper shrimp. The dim sum is excellent, and the cheapest of the big three (by a good margin).</bdi>]], [[<b>Yee Heung Seafood House</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">225 W Cermak Rd</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Feeling peckish for authentic food in the wee hours of the morning? This is the place, and may be the best place after most close.</bdi>]], [[<b>Ed's Potsticker House</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">3139 S Halsted St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">One of Chicago's great neighborhood restaurants, though you would never know it from the inauthentic sounding name. Chicago's Chinese community more and more bleeds across neighborhood boundaries into Bridgeport proper, and this restaurant is the showcase of the culinary possibilities this creates for the area. It's a mom and pop run Chinese restaurant specializing in Northern Chinese cuisine. There are a lot of great dishes on the menu (hint, not the ones you've heard of before) \\u2014 aim for the lamb cumin, soup dumplings, or the whole Szechuan style tilapia.</bdi>]], [[<b>Gio's Cafe &amp; Deli</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2724 S Lowe Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Some of Chicago's best Italian is hidden in a tiny checkerboard tablecloth deli, more resembling a grocery store than a restaurant, hidden further still in the residential streets of Bridgeport. It's also, as you might expect, a steal of a bargain. Delicious Italian pastas, chicken, and panini.</bdi>]], [[<b>Pancho Pistola's</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">700 W 31st St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Authentic and very solid food in a nice sit-down family owned Mexican restaurant notable for its great margaritas. One of Bridgeport's trendiest restaurants.</bdi>]], [[<b>Han 202</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">605 W 31st St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">High class, trendy dining on the cheap! But the neighborhood's new Han 202 has taken off, and its chef's cooking has attracted favorable comparisons to some of the flashiest and most esteemed in the city. The rave reviews are no doubt reinforced by the extraordinary deal \\u2014 $25 for a fixed price five-course meal, plus BYOB with no corkage fee.</bdi>]], [[<b>Lao Sze Chuan</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2172 S Archer Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Often considered the best Chinese in the Chicagoland area, Lao Sze Chuan serves up fiery Szechuan cuisine. Not only is the food excellent, the service is as well, and it even has a nice ambiance. As is often the case in Chinatown, sometimes the most inauthentic sounding names hide the best dishes; Tony's Chicken is the restaurant's rightly famous dish, served with three types of chili sauce. Other famous dishes include their very unusual cumin lamb, as well as the tea duck. If what you want isn't on the menu, tell them what you want and how you want it cooked \\u2014 they'll likely invent the dish on the spot!</bdi>]], [[<b>Phoenix</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2131 S Archer Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">The Phoenix is the gold standard in Chicago dim sum, and with good reason. It's the one of the three top dim sum establishments that actually has nice decor, which, naturally, you pay for. Unlike the other good dim sum options, Phoenix uses the ever-popular wheeled cart method of delivery. The one downside to Phoenix is that it is better known, and therefore a good deal more crowded (and expensive) than most Chinatown restaurants \\u2014 it pays to arrive either early or late to avoid the crowd.</bdi>]], [[<b>Polo Cafe &amp; Catering Bridgeport USA</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">3322 S Morgan St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A fine Bridgeport steakhouse decked with Mayor Daley-worship decor. Show up early on Saturday for the \"Bloody Mary Brunch\" and try \"The Mayor's Steak and Eggs.\"</bdi>]], [[<b>Bernice &amp; John's</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">3238 S Halsted St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A laid back and particularly friendly Bridgeport dive bar with Thursday open mic nights that have caught on well with local artists.</bdi>]], [[<b>Bridgeport Coffeehouse</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">3101 S Morgan St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Starbucks doesn't exist in Bridgeport and in this coffeehouse, the staff knows their customers by name. Features original blends roasted in house and some excellent loose-leaf teas. Free wireless, live jazz on Sundays, and live blues on Wednesdays.</bdi>]], [[<b>First Base</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">3201 S Normal Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A lively bar with some good Irish stout on tap. It gets raucous when the Sox are playing.</bdi>]], [[<b>Mitchell's Tap</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">3356 S Halsted St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Lots of different kinds of beer, bowling, golf machines, and frequent live music.</bdi>]], [[<b>Maria's Packaged Goods &amp; Community Bar</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">960 W 31st St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Longtime Chicago scenester Ed Marszewski and his brother Mike have re-launched their mother's stalwart bar and liquor store as a community bar. Expect regular performances from 90s no-wave and post-rock bands, electronic artists and performance artists. Ed's connections to the art scene are broad and deep (he's thrown parties at venues ranging from warehouses to the MCA), so the entertainment should be good.</bdi>]], [[<b>Schaller's Pump</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">3714 S Halsted St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">This family-owned Irish-American bar is the oldest in the city \\u2014 founded in 1881. The former speakeasy gets really crowded during and after Sox games, but it's always a good place to spot local power-brokers \\u2014 it's just across the street from the Democratic Ward office. Regardless of whether you're here after a Sox game or you're just hatching political plots, you can enjoy a mighty fine corned beef and cabbage sandwich.</bdi>]], [[<b>Chinatown Hotel</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">214 W 22nd Pl</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Free wired internet and computers. One of the best budget options anywhere near downtown Chicago. And to top it off, its right by all sorts of delicious and cheap Chinese restaurants. But do remember that it is a budget spot \\u2014 staff speaks limited English and accommodations are pretty spare (might remind backpackers of China travels).</bdi>]], [[<b>Benedictine Bed &amp; Breakfast</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">3111 S Aberdeen St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Cozy spacious rooms within an urban Benedictine monastery. The price is <i>way</i> lower than what you would spend in a downtown hotel, but the accommodations actually blow those hotels out of the water (multiple rooms, private gardens!), and the monastery and the surrounding neighborhood have much more character.

Since then, the theater has served as a church, and then a performance venue, before finally shuttering its doors in 2003. In 2008, however, the building caught a glimmer of new hope with a purchase by new owners hoping to turn the building into a new cultural venue. The idea hasn't quite taken hold yet, but there is reason to feel optimistic about this Chicago Landmark's long-term future. If you are not getting in for an event in the meantime (and believe it, the interior is in fabulous shape and incredibly beautiful), check out the cool mural on the side and ponder the building's incredible musical history; the venue's performers truly include every single world class blues, jazz, rhythm &amp; blues, funk, and soul musician you can think of: John Coltrane, Count Basie, Nat King Cole, Sammy Davis Jr, Earth Wind &amp; Fire, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, the Supremes, Gladys Knight, the Isley Brothers, Billie Holiday, Isaac Hayes, B.B.

Wells, Mayor William Hale Thompson (perhaps Chicago's most eccentric leader), and the first black mayor of Chicago, Harold Washington Jr. One of the more striking monuments is the memorial to the overwhelming <i>6,000</i> Confederate prisoners of war who died at Camp Douglas (on the site of the present day Illinois Institute of Technology in <a href=\"/wiki/Chicago/Bronzeville\" title=\"Chicago/Bronzeville\">Bronzeville</a>).

Wicker Park must be becoming way too corporate. Seriously this is the nicest Walgreens you will ever visit, topping even the CVS above in terms of adaptive reuse of a beautiful old bank building. They have lots of upscale goods like sushi and frozen yogurt and you're even greeted by a guy in a suit, bringing to mind the fancy Taco Bell scene in <i>Demolition Man</i>.

But the pizza wars are truly a fraud, overlooking pizza (more precisely, apizza) from the humbler city of <a href=\"/wiki/New_Haven\" title=\"New Haven\">New Haven</a>, which may indeed may be the best of them all. Chicago's new coal-fired pizza oven serves some of the best apizza outside New Haven, and while it may seem irreverent to eat pizza from <a href=\"/wiki/Connecticut\" title=\"Connecticut\">Connecticut</a> while in Chicago, you'd honestly be hard pressed to do better.</bdi>]], [[<b>The Handlebar</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2311 W North Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A vegetarian friendly restaurant and beer garden in Wicker Park, and the headquarters of Chicago's bicycle culture.</bdi>]], [[<b>Piece Brewery &amp; Pizzeria</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">1927 W North Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Thin-crust pizza and micro-brews.

One of the best places in the city for people watching, the bar/restaurant can be unbelievably crowded and it might be better just to grab a few tacos to go from the carryout window and watch all the hipsters/yuppies running around the Damen stop about while waiting for your food.</bdi>]], [[<b>Mirai</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2020 W Division St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Future style and fresh sushi in formidable amounts, with a second-floor sake lounge.

(Excepting the neighbors, that is, who are trying to get it closed down.) It's not easy to find but it's a landmark, so follow the noise or spend the cheap-beer savings on a cab.</bdi>]], [[<b>Phyllis' Musical Inn</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">1800 W Division St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Everyone feels welcome at the Musical Inn. Outdoor seating is packed on Division in the summer, which is why this is one to know \\u2014 few people are aware that a great beer garden lurks behind the tall stone fence next door to Phyllis', which looks like a garden variety dive bar at first glance.

The sound system is good, too. It's run by the owners of the Metro in <a href=\"/wiki/Chicago/Lakeview-North_Center\" title=\"Chicago/Lakeview-North Center\">Lakeview</a>, which means that the roster of bands can seem like the Metro's leftovers \\u2014 jam bands, local bands, and the occasional 90s alt-rock refugee.</bdi>]], [[<b>Empty Bottle</b>, <b>Bite</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">1035 N Western Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">To Chicago as the Knitting Factory is to <a href=\"/wiki/New_York_City\" title=\"New York City\">NYC</a>, the Empty Bottle hosts a mix of touring indie-rock veterans, local bands, and occasional appearances by American and Dutch avant-garde jazz.

The place is a bit hard to find, hidden as it is next to the city's main north-side refueling station for garbage trucks, but it's more than worth the trouble. Of special interest to old-timey fans is the regular Tuesday night appearance of <b>Devil in a Woodpile</b>.</bdi>]], [[<b>Subterranean</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2011 W North Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A laid-back club with diverse music and crowd.

Eliot's <i>The Waste Land</i>, The Violet Hour is hidden away \\u2014 there's no sign, and no name on the door. Inside, though, is a marvelous, decadent, Alice-in-Wonderland plus speakeasy vibe. It's a <i>great</i> place for a date. The cocktails are $11-12, but they won't disappoint \\u2014 certified mixologists take up to four minutes to make them.

It's also a very cheap one, and deceptively well-located (a few minutes' walk from the Blue Line in Logan Square, right on the Milwaukee bus line).

The collection pays tribute to more than 200 inductees from many professional sports, with Joe DiMaggio held in highest esteem.

The United Center doesn't have much in the way of character as a stadium, but the sightlines are great from anywhere in the house, and both teams are on an upswing. Fans of Michael Jordan (who played here from 1996-98) should look for his jersey in the rafters and his statue outside. (Check the statue details \\u2014 he's wearing stone Air Jordans!)

A dizzy list of silent movie giants shot films here, Charlie Chaplin and local girl Gloria Swanson among them, and the city's awful winters played a part in shifting production to California for part of the year.

Chicago history lies in rest here, from the major names (Burnham, Sullivan, Field, Pullman, Mies) to the footnotes (Charles Dickens' obscure brother Augustus).

It shifted from big-band sensation to prizefight arena and swinging mod disco, but it's been in good hands for more than thirty years now, as promoters for Latin dances and rock shows split nights of the week.</bdi>]], [[<b>The Green Mill</b>, <b>weekly poetry slam</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">4802 N Broadway St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Jazz and lots of it at this Uptown landmark, famously an old hangout of Al Capone (who's not, though, around as much as he used to be).

It's extremely popular with Chicago's gay and lesbian community, and also with Edgewater families. There are paths for rollerblading or running near the beach. Note the huge pink Edgewater Beach Apartments building amid the skyline \\u2014 they were originally part of a larger (pink) hotel, built in 1927.</bdi>]], [[<b>Hartigan Park &amp; Beach</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">1031 W Albion St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Close to the university and the student housing.

Pratt Beach includes North Shore Beach and Columbia Beach to the south, and it segues into Loyola Park &amp; Beach to the north with the long art wall, making them the longest public beach in Chicago.</bdi>]], [[<b>Loyola Park &amp; Beach</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">1230 W Greenleaf Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Wide open spaces are here: room for soccer, basketball courts, and a public field for baseball (along with one non-public field).

Jarvis Beach is more popular with younger swimmers as they are under the watchful gaze of the Chicago Junior Life Guard program. It also offers some open space to toss a Frisbee or people-watch. Fargo Beach is a real gem with its community garden of native beach grasses, decorating the sea retaining wall that separates the beach from the property to the west.  Don\\u2019t miss the wonderful plantings in the \\u201ctree box\\u201d at the end of Fargo Ave. The local take ownership for this beach and it shows.  Be careful; many a local \\u201coutdoorsman\\u201d has been known to illegally launch a kayak from this public beach, and the dogs off leashes can get a bit \\u201chairy\\u201d at times.  Sherwin Beach, connected to the south of Jarvis Beach, is a small sand spit that offers a chance to sneer at the adjacent private beach.</bdi>]], [[<b>Howard Beach</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">7519 N Eastlake Terrace</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">There's a pretty good playground here, and a modestly-sized beach.</bdi>]], [[<b>Rogers Beach</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">7705 N Eastlake Terrace</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">The perfect size for a beach, with tennis courts and a cliff for contemplative strolls, picnic space and a modest strip of sand for swimmers.</bdi>]], [[<b>Juneway Terrace Beach</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">7800 N Eastlake Terrace</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">This is it: you've reached the end of Chicago, and it's a nice one, with lots of green space and a fun jump down to the sand.

Their costume selection is terrific, but it's worth the visit just to have a look around.</bdi>]], [[<b>Taste Food &amp; Wine</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">1506 W Jarvis Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">A lovely little wine shoppe, with a nice spread of moderately-priced wines, some beers and ciders, and various tasty nibbles. (Prosciutto? Roasted figs? Cornichons? Oh, yes.) The wines don't favor any one geographical location overmuch, and tend to lean towards a pleasantly high quaffability quotient instead of veering towards either pole of self-pickling (musty snobbery on one end, and \"get me loaded up on that box o'vino\" on the other). The Monday and Friday tastings are a treat, as are conversations with the friendly staff.</bdi>]], [[<b>Unan Imports</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">6971 N Sheridan Rd</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">This tiny, wonderful shop stocks African imports ranging from clothing, jewelry and masks to beauty products and djembe (drums from Mali).

If you're at this one, you'll find a glorious clutter of Indian gifts \\u2014 if these are cheap tourist statuettes, for example, they certainly don't look like it.</bdi>]], [[<b>Raj Jewel</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2652 W Devon Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Of the many jewelry shops on Devon, Raj Jewel has the most flash and class, with uniformed employees on hand to show off a substantial collection of gold and diamond jewelry.</bdi>]], [[<b>Regal</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2616 W Devon Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">There is the requisite selection of beautiful saris, but fans of pastel men's dress shirts will fall silent with awe at the treasures to be found here.</bdi>]], [[<b>Sahil</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2605 W Devon Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">This is the height of retail elegance on Devon \\u2014 the two sparkling floors of Sahil wouldn't look out of place on the <a href=\"/wiki/Chicago/Near_North\" title=\"Chicago/Near North\">Magnificent Mile</a>.

If you don't mind spending freely, you'll leave with some amazing outfits.</bdi>]], [[<b>Taj Sari Palace</b>, <b>Al-Raheem</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2553 W Devon Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">There are nice saris for women and juniors at this long-standing boutique, but the craft-minded will delight in the reams of colorful fabric sold here, suitable for making saris, men's suits, and home decorations. <b>Al-Raheem</b> at 2655 W Devon also sells reams of fabric.</bdi>]], [[<b>Annapurna</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2608 W Devon Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Devon Avenue can boggle the mind of the weary vegetarian not accustomed to having this many choices. Annapurna is a hole in the wall and the menu is geared toward Hindi speakers, but this is a good place to try something new \\u2014 or just ask for samosas and chaat, and you shall receive.</bdi>]], [[<b>Argo Georgian Bakery</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2812 W Devon Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">If you haven't had <a href=\"/wiki/Georgia_(country)\" title=\"Georgia (country)\">Georgian</a> food, your culinary life has yet to begin. Drop everything you are doing and head straight to this bakery to try khachapuri, a mouth wateringly-flaky cheese-filled pastry. Try some Borjomi sparkling spring water too. The bakery's hours seem subject to managerial whim (and the Georgians are whimsical folks), so it's wise to call ahead before visiting. <a href=\"/wiki/Georgian_phrasebook\" title=\"Georgian phrasebook\">Georgian</a> is the only language spoken, so practice saying Hah-chah-poo-ree and Bohr-joh-mee.</bdi>]], [[<b>Capt'n Nemo's</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">7367 N Clark St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">One of Chicago's best sandwich and soup deals.

This isn't the gourmet Devon experience, but how's this sound: naan or chapatis, chicken biryani, and a mango lassi to drink for less than $5. Interested? Come and carry-out, or try the family room.</bdi>]], [[<b>Noon Hour Grill</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">6930 N Glenwood Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">It doesn't look like much from the outside, but where else are you going to have to choose between a hearty diner breakfast (bacon, sausage, eggs), Korean home cooking (bi bim bop, Yook Gue Jung soup), or the point at which they meet (Korean spaghetti, bulgogi and kimchee omelettes)?  Potential patrons should be aware the restaurant has been accused of refusing to serve lesbians and gay men.</bdi>]], [[<b>Wolfy's</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2734 W Peterson Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Hot dogs and Polish sausages are a powerful, ancient tradition in West Ridge, and while there are still plenty of fast food shacks in the area, Wolfy's is the last of the old-school, pilgrimage-worthy hot dog proprietors. For a bit of hot dog history, sneak a peek at the hot dog sculptures behind the now-closed U Lucky Dawg (formerly Fluky's) a short distance east at 6821 N Western.</bdi>]], [[<b>Arya Bhavan</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2508 W Devon Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">The first thing you notice is the pink handkerchiefs, floating over the tables like butterflies. Arya Bhavan has a small but lovely dining room, serving mostly northern Indian food (and a weekend buffet) for vegans. As a bonus, it's open most major holidays.</bdi>]], [[<b>Khan BBQ</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">2401 W Devon Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">If you've had it with vegetarians, this is where to get some meat on your plate.

The key is to confirm that Peggy is working that day; if she's in the kitchen, make tracks to enjoy the work of one of the finest pizza auteurs of our time.</bdi>]], [[<b>Heartland Cafe</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">7000 N Glenwood Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">There's almost always something going on at the hippie-friendly Heartland Cafe: open mic nights, live rock/jazz/blues, plays, and art/photo exhibits. While vegetarian-friendly, the menu is a bit overpriced and sub-par \\u2014 you are paying for the ambiance. The outdoor seating is a pleasure in the summer. Check out the \"kozmic\" bookstore (and the photobooth) while you're waiting for a table.</bdi>]], [[<b>Moody's Pub</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">5910 N Broadway St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">An Edgewater institution since 1959, serving beer and monster Moodyburgers.

Trinity United, to the dismay of its congregants, rocketed to international infamy in the space of seconds during then Senator Obama's presidential campaign, when news outlets got their hands on a fiery sermon by the then pastor Jeremiah Wright. In the now famous clip, replayed endlessly for weeks across the cable news networks, Rev. Wright cried out, \"God damn America!\" The ensuing characterization of the church was hardly fair, with the short clip shown out of context, and the context itself being one very much alien to most Americans, who had not had any experience of the often radical social justice traditions of the African-American Church. In part because he was unhappy to see his former congregation harassed by reporters, and in part because his increasingly flamboyant pastor was continuing to embarrass and hurt his campaign, Obama left the church, allowing things to calm down over time, and for the congregation to get back to its purposes of worship and charity.</bdi>]], [[<b>The Union Stock Yard Gate</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">4200 S Peoria St</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">This limestone structure marks the entrance to the now defunct Union Stock Yards that dominated this section of Chicago (and the meatpacking industry of the country) in the late 19th-early 20th centuries.

The basic burger will do you right, but there are a bunch of other interesting options, like fiery burgers made with hot peppers ground into the beef. The decor, as with many established South Side eateries, celebrates Chicago's black history, with old photographs of Mayor Harold Washington and a not-so-old Barack Obama signature.

Their shrimp and gizzards are simply outstanding, and their hot sauce is beloved enough by the East Siders that it's made its way into local grocery stores. Any way you slice it, the piping hot, cholesterol laden, made to order food here will be great, but it's best enjoyed on the hood of your car while gazing off into the nearby smokestacks.</bdi>]], [[<b>Mexican Inn</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">9510 S Ewing Ave</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">Fine authentic Mexican food served up in the East Side's most pleasant and most narrow restaurant.

The Chicago-style thin crust pizzas here hold up well against the best in the city, with the famous entree being the garlic-drenched \"Bob's Mistake.\" Downsides include high prices (for thin crust) and very limited seating \\u2014 just two small tables, usually taken up by people waiting for their order.</bdi>]], [[<b>Club 81, Too</b>], [<bdi class=\"adr listing-address street-address\">13157 S Avenue M</bdi>], [<bdi class=\"note listing-content\">The bar at the end of Chicago.

Amazingly you <i>can</i> smoke here, despite the ban, as the owner openly flouts it, keeping a \"smoking tip jar\" as a collection for paying the fines.
